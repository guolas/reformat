Looking at the problems with a couple of lines for the G.INP pilot of SFR. We are trying to get the information that Jeonghun requested on a mail on 2015-04-13 [subject: Re: GINP Pilot Stage 0 - Round 3].

The lines in question are:

    130510140    <-- VDSL, returning `null` FETR.
    134691053    <-- ADSL, returning a FETR much higher than the sync rate.

For the first line he wants the DS LEFTRS and maybe logs gotten from running manually PE for a single `line_id`.

To check the FETRS, we search in the table `ADC_POP_P`, which identifies the lines with the field `tn`, which is equivalent to the `line_id`. Now this table has an index by `tn` and `collection_date`, so with something like this:

    select tn, leftrs_fend, leftrs_nend from adc_pop_p where
    tn = '130510140' and
    collection_date > sysdate - 7 and
    leftrs_fend is not null
    order by collection_date desc;

We can collect the information requested.

Now, the LEFTRS is the Low EFTR seconds, which is the time during which the line is bellow a defined lower bound. This bound is defined in the parameter `LEFTR_THRESH_DS` and `LEFTR_THRESH_US`, which is defined for the profile, in the view `V_PROFILES`.

For the problematic line:

    select LEFTR_THRESH_DS, LEFTR_THRESH_US from v_profiles where
    NAME = (select current_profile from PO_STATE where
    line_id = '130510140');

And the result is:

    LEFTR_THRESH_DS LEFTR_THRESH_US
    --------------- ---------------
                  0

Because it only has a GINP profile assigned for the DS:

    select ginp_us, ginp_ds from line_profile where
    name = (select current_profile from PO_STATE where
    line_id = '130510140');

With the result:

    GINP_US GINP_DS
    ------- ----------------------------

================================================================================
                          [Conference call with SFR] 

The only topic for today is G.INP.

They had an issue with Alcatel DSLAM because ASSIA was sending something, and they had to push a workaround from their part, but I am not sure what was happening.

We still have an ISAM line with VDSL profile for which the profile change didn't work. They more or less know what is happening and there is someone already working (aude?) on it.

They need us all to put in common the way the profiles are called and spelled (case, and things).

They are going to audit all the names of the profiles to make sure they are more or less consistent.

They will check `LINE_PROFILE` for the name of the profiles.

They deploy things on a regional basis, divinding the country in different parts, so that they may have different things for different parts of the country. But that is something only they know about that.

Another issue with Huawei was the VDVM thing that we fixed, the swapped subprofile names, so they will check it today/tomorrow if it is OK, because we pushed the patch this morning.

They are going to re-enter all the lines in the pilot (the whole lot of them, 10) in PO, to see if everything works fine.

They want to be sure that the system works OK before inserting the 100 lines of stage 1 (right now we are in system 0).

We ask them to inform us when they are going to insert the lines for the next stage. They probably will insert them on Monday, so they will let us know by Friday.

There are no news about IPv6, because they are still waiting for a commercial proposal. So no new technical information. Ergo, on hold.

We remember that we have to look into the problem with the lines in the SERENITY profiles. From their part, they are more or less on the same situation, no news about it (no news are good news), waiting for other people to do their job, I guess. But they do not sound too worried.
================================================================================

Seguimos con lo de contestar a Jeonghun, para lo cuÃ¡l hay que mandarle:

Lo que tenemos que mandarle:

- PE log for the VDPM VDSL line (130510140) [pe_logs_line_id_130510140.7z].

- Firmware of the line card for the VDPM ADSL line (134691053), and compare it to the firmware and vendor id of the line card for another line in the G.INP pilot, that is collecting the G.INP data correctly (130185997):

    select * from vendor_id_info_latest
    where line_id = '134691053' or
    line_id = '130185997';

`VENDORID_FIELD2` is the chipset, and for both lines is 6E62367600000000 (remember that in this case it is in hexadecimal), and `VENDORID_FIELD3` is the firmware version, and for both it is A2PV6F038M (for the ISAM card, the one working correctly, the value is 4132707636463033386D000000000000, which is the hexadecimal representation of the same firmware version, except for the case, but I guess that is not important).

- PO is run for the line (130042382), which is in PO but for some reason it is not reporting AVG_EFTR_START nor END. It has the same chipset and firmware 

- We have also checked the firmware of the lines that are not synchronizing with G.INP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-16]

There has been a mail from Guillame with the result of their audit of the profiles they have, which is a terrible mess.

He has some comments for us, and some actions that they and AUDE should take.

His first point, is that we have configured a profile:

    25024k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::25M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

which was not defined, and should be:

    25024k_1216k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::25M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

and he is right, because we introduced the error of using 1024 "influenced" by the 1M in the RTX profile (as indicated in the document with the profiles and service products for the G.INP release, page 12, of version 1.3 of the document).

It is defined in the "SFR profiles new services vXX.xlsx" spreadsheet, in the sheet "ISAM GINP profiles". We have changed it, and saved to version v3.0, and then we have to re-generate the tmatrix and the XML files.

His other two complaints are unfounded, so probably he got lost with all the terrible messy mess that the profiles and their names is.

Firstly, he talks about some profiles with `INP_auto_auto_fast_fast_0_0` that should be `INP_2_2_16_16_40_7`, but they are the profiles assigned to the service GAMER, as seen in the document `Profils_SR_SFR_V5.xlsx`.

The same happens with the profiles with sub-profile `NM_5_5_adaptatinit`, which is the defined one for the service DOWNLOAD.

So now we have to generate the internal ticket in JIRA:

Then generate the XML files:

    create_profilesSFRXml.m

Then generate the tmatrix

    create_TMatrices_SFR.m

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-17]

These files are located in:

    dsloExpresseAdditional/poConfigCreator/sfr

And they generate the folder `profiles` and the folder `tmatrix`.

The files generated should be compared with the ones in:

    dsloExpresse/config/profiles/profiles/profiles_lineprofiles/profiles_lineprofiles_neuf/src/main/resources/profiles
    dsloExpresse/config/stm/config/stm_sfr/src/main/resources/tmatrix

The idea is check that the newly generated differ in the part that was intended (the profile that was wrongly named).


================================================================================
[meeting with the sales people from Europe]

The idea is to go through all the accounts to see where we are and where we can go.

The brittish guy wants to set a sales meeting by 1st month into the quarter to see how everything is going. He is new to the company and that is what he is going to be doing, meeting among them and with us.

Well ... the main idea I am getting from this meeting, apart from getting to know about the different accounts that we have... we are super short on people.

We are just overwhelmed by the great expectations of the rest of the people of the company.

Not enough people in deployment, not enough people in systems.

And there is another problem: vacation time, not enough people... how is anyone going to take vacations, when there is no one to cover for that?

Apparently Collin is going to raise some of the troubles kind of troubling us to the high instances of the company... Pete Chow and such.
================================================================================

Once everything is check that the modifications are right, copy it from the "additional" part to the "normal" part.

Make sure that the versions in  `pom.xml` are the correct ones: this is, if there is a -SNAPSHOT, leave it there, if it is not, then increase the version and add the -SNAPSHOT suffix.

If everything is correct, then go on and do the local build, or using the machine LEXUS.

- First for the profiles --> and it succeeded

- Then the stm --> and PROBLEMS!

It seems that in lexus it is failing because of the access to the database.

According to Isa, who is probably right, it is likely to be due to config settings for maven.

The same seems to happen locally in my laptop.

We will look at it on Monday, when she is going to send me her configuration for me to adapt/use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-20]

There is mail from Guillaume, where he comments something "strange" (for him), which is that the line 130510140 got the recommendation of the profile:

    DRDSV_80000k_608k:DRUSV_10000k_160k:NMV_6_6_adaptatinit:INPV_2_2_16_16_8_0_10:SPECTRUMV_8b_ginp:RFIV_disable:UPBOV_d_eqfext_klo_min:DPBOV_disable:VNV_disable

and he wants to know why the 8b standard was selected instead of the 17a, for the case of recommending a rate of 80Mbps, because according to him with 8b it is not possible to get rates higher than 50Mbps. But the use of that rate and that standard is contemplated in the profile specifications document, so not sure about why they put it there if they know that is not possible.

Isa has told me that our own calibration information tell us that it is possible to synchronize the line using the standard 8b, for rates higher than 50Mbps, for short loops.

Isa has explained me the differences between the two VDSL standards:

- 8b  --> max_power = 20.4dBm, max_freq = 8MHz
- 17a --> max_power = 14.5dBm, max_freq = 17MHz

For shorter loops, 17a is able to deliver higher rates, but for longer loops, the increased distance attenuates more the high frequencies, and 8b is more appropriate.

But the PO will evaluate both options, because it is configured to do so, and stick to the one with the higher rates.

We have to look in the table PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO to try to guess why the 8b standard was recommended, instead of the 17a.

===

In the meantime I am trying to finish the fix for the profile change we did last week.

Once Isa has sent me the correct `settings.xml` for maven, I can do the build.

I had no problems building the profiles, with the new profile changed, but I was getting an error building the stm (config -> stm -> config_stm_sfr) because I didn't change its pom.xml to use the correct version of the profiles.

The way this works is: config_stm (po_config.version) uses profiles_lineprofiles (profiles.version).

After both builds are successful, the DB should be built too.

In this case it is necessary to specify the correct version of both the profiles and po_config, and this is done in the pom.xml of:

releases -> <customer> -> <customer>_db

Apart from the correct versions of profiles and po_config, it is necessary to configure some other things in this pom.xml.

This step is supposed to generate and populate the DB from scratch, and also generate a DB with its currect status and applying a differential change, based on the changes made.

For the differential part, in the pom.xml there is a block to configure it. There are a series of lines that are commented, and it is necessary to uncomment the lines corresponding to the changes that are going to be made in the DB.

In the case of the fix we are working on, it involved just a change in the DB for the profiles, so only the part corresponding to "SFR specific profiles" is to be left uncommented.

Then when that part is built successfuly, then the:

releases -> <customer> -> <customer>_release_generator

pom.xml has to be updated to use the correct version of whatever it is using and has changed, for example in our case, po_config.version

Next, create a JIRA ticket. An internal ticket assigned to product ASSIA DSL-Expresse.

For internal tickets, ALWAYS include the name of the customer, so that they are easy to spot.

After that, checkout the newly uploaded content from CVS in the machine lexus, so that the whole testing can be performed there.

After download, the sequences is:

1.- config -> profiles -> profiles_lineprofiles
2.- config -> stm -> cofig_stm
3.- releases -> <customer> -> <customer>_db
4.- releases -> <customer> -> <customer>_release_generator


===

We have found out, thanks to another email from Guillaume, that we had some other profiles with the name wrong, something like:

25024k_1216k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::25M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

instead of:

25024k_1216k_inp1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::25M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

It is correct with the `inp` in lower case. This happened for some profiles of ISAM GINP and ISAM GINP VDSL profiles.

So we have to generate, again, the profiles and the tmatrix.

Also, Isa has spotted some problem with a tmatrix where there is a problem with the transitions, with some missing, for ISAM VDSL GINP.

- For the profile with 100M, there are no transitions allowed to reduce the speed.
- For the profile with 90M, there are no transitions allowed to increase the speed.

Sara has found that this is due to a test in the function `isProfileTransitionAllowed_SFR`.

There was a test for non Phy-R profiles, and all of the new profiles were getting in there. So there are some situations:

   (target rate > original rate) AND (target INP != original INP)
    OR
   (target rate < original rate) AND (target INP < original INP)

So, for the profile:

    100M_50M_inp2:VDSL2_8b_6dB_D_EqFxt::100M_50M_s8_r0_r10_d16

Cannot transition to a perfil like:

    90M_25M_inp1:VDSL2_8b_6dB_D_EqFxt::90M_25M_s8_r0_r10_d16

Because the target rate is lower and the target INP is lower.

Similarly, from the 90M it cannot transition to the 100M profile because of the first condition (target rate greater and target INP different).

The same happens for other profiles like:

    EXP_M_16000k_1216k_INP2:VDSL2_8b_6dB_D_EqFxt::16M_1216k_s8_r0_r10_d16

That does not transition to the 18M profile.

Changing the following condition in the script `isProfileTransitionAllowed_SFR`:

    if ~targetProfile.isPhyR && ~originalProfile.isPhyR

For:

    if ~targetProfile.isPhyR && ~originalProfile.isPhyR &&
       isempty(strfind(SP.name,'GINP'))

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-21]

I had a reply from Jeonghun about the logs we sent him the last week. And not with good news.

The first one, about the line 130510140, we sent him the log of the PE, but it seems that in the log it says that there are no counters for the last 25h. He also commented that the CSV (shame on me, it was a regular text file, not a CSV) there were no timestamps, so it was not any good.

We have seen one curious thing about his, which is that in the table ADC_POP_P there are samples for the dates of interest, within the 25h window that he mentions.

Apart from that, we have seen that in the log of the PE, where it says that there are no counters found, he is checking in a time frame from:

start date: 1428987611000, end date: 1429074011000

And it gives information about dsAvgEftr for the dates

start date: 1428678000000, end date: 1428884100000

Which are, both of them, previous to the start date of interest... I don not understand this.

According to Isa, this is already fixed, and it was due to the following:

- Right now, as it is some kind of pilot, nothing permanent, there are two DcPc running, one of them collecting non-G.INP information, and the other one G.INP ready. The problem is that the PO was using the samples from the non-G.INP DcPc, and that is why there were no information available.

- The PO is configured to get the information from some part in the DB, and this is configured in the App Server in the following file:

    /usr/local/dslexpresse/server/config/stm.properties

Here the properties:

    po.popo.table.name
    po.popp.table.name

are configured to use a certain view from the DB, in particular:

    V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL
    V_ADC_POP_P_GINP_TRIAL

which have been fixed to include, for G.INP lines, only the collection from the G.INP DcPc, avoidind to have nulls.

As a side note, the PE is configured in:

    /usr/local/dslexpresse/server/config/bulk/Bulk.pe.config

For the line 130042382, which is not showing AVG_EFTR_START nor AVG_EFTR_END in PO_STATE, despite seeming to be ok in PE (not-null values), the log that we sent him essentially was useless: it tells, immediately, that it was not processed by the PO because of "inconsistent equipment information".

Well, the problem we have seen is that the PO failed when we launched it manually, with exit code 672, which is "Line was removed". If the line is looked up in PORT_INFO, the status of the line is 2, which means that it has been administratively set to out of service, I guess the client unregistered it.

Another side note, the status in PORT_INFO can be 0 or 2, 2 meaning that is out of service, and 0 meaning that the line is active.

Still, there are no lines with G.INP with the AVG_EFTR_START and AVG_EFTR_END fields populated with anything but null, ask about this.

So try to get a PO log for some other line in this situation to send it over to Jeonghun

He had previously asked for the firmware version of a CPE, and he is "happy" wiht the information, for the line 130185997, because it rules out a potential issue with the CPE, and he suggests that we continue the investigation around the line card.

----

Before continuing to look at the lines for the G.INP pilot, I am finishing the fixes for the capitalized profile names and for the wrong tmatrix transitions.

I have learned today that even though there are some profiles with a given speed and there are others with lower speeds, the transition may not be allowed by the definition of the commercial service, not because of the profile itself.

The parameters of the commercial service are given in the table CONFIG_SERVICE_PRODUCT, the example I have run into is the product SP_3P_MROOM_GINP, which has a minimum rate of 6144 kbps, so no transition to lower profiles are allowed.

----

More things: ISAM DSLAMs seems to not support DS+US rates greater than 120M, and in some email thread, ASSIA agreed with SFR that they would not be considered, but they are being considered.

It all comes down to some condition test in the script that generates the Tmatrix. It seems that they included a column in the spreadsheets used as source to generate the Tmatrix, called `type`, which would be 2 for normal profiles, and 1 for profiles not allowed (exceeding the DS+US cap).

For some reason Sara does not remember, in the code there is a part that considers this extra column, but it is commented, so... misterious right here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-22]

- I have been the whole day trying to fix the issue with the profile names and the Tmatrix with the wrong transitions.

- Now continue to gather the PO log for a line in the G.INP pilot for SFR, because for all the lines in that pilot, even though they are using G.INP, are null for DS_AVG_EFTR_{START,END} in PO_RECORD and PO_STATE:

    SELECT * FROM PO_RECORD WHERE
    LINE_ID = '223155007'
    ORDER BY DATE_REQUEST DESC;

    SELECT * FROM PO_STATE WHERE
    LINE_ID = '223155007'
    ORDER BY DATE_REQUEST DESC;

But in the table ADSL_PE_EST_SL there is information about 

    DS_AVG_EFTR

I have launched the PO for a single line, the 223155007, to get the log and send it to Jeonghun.

But Isa has seen something "strange":

- It seems that the line was in PO_STATE, but it was removed and put there again.

- She thinks that the process reads the VENDOR_ID from a view, for SFR, and it seems that the SingleLine mode is not getting this configuration, so it detects a change of CPE (appartently, in the view, for the lines of SFR, the CPE are mapped to `NO DATA`, to prevent this, it is only allowed for Bouygues).

- Another thing is that, in theory, SingleLine should not touch the DB.

I am going to send the log in any case, to see if it is of any use for Jeonghun.

Well, I have not sent it because Isa found some other thing that we are going to try:

- She has found that there is a property called:

    po.consider.ginp.counters.for.profile.evaluation

which was set to `false`, and by the name, it looks suspicious that is set to false, and maybe we want it set to `true`, so Isa has changed it in production, and I have changed it, opened the ticket and committed the changes so that it can be included in the next release with the fixes for the profiles names and the tmatrices. The ticket involved in these three things are:

DSLE-12406
DSLE-12380
DSLE-12368

This `stm.properties.diff` is located in:

    /dsloExpresse/releases/neuf/neuf_release_generator/src/main/resources/server

And it just includes the things that are changed with respect to the default values, which are located... somewhere... some day I will know, I hope :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-23]

The field TXMODEDS in the table ADC_POP_O indicates if the line is synchronizing using G.INP or not. A value of 2 is G.INP, a value of 0 or null is non-G.INP.

We have checked that after the change made by Isa yesterday evening, setting the property to true, the information about EFTR is being populated in PO_STATE.

But still we have seen some things:

- Some lines still report a null START.
- Some lines still report a null START and END.
- Some lines report non-null END (!!).

Still we have to remimd Jeonghun that ADPD and VDPM cards in ADSL mode are showing a high EFTR, compared to the synchronization rate. This can be checked with the query:

    SELECT CARD_TYPE, SYSTEMTYPE, LINE_ID, DS_AVG_EFTR / DS_SYNCH_RATE
    FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL_LATEST
    JOIN V_PORTS_LINE_CARD_DATA USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
    AND DS_AVG_EFTR / DS_SYNCH_RATE > 1
    ORDER BY CARD_TYPE ASC;

In CARD_TYPE it can be seen that they are ADPD and VDPM, and in SYSTEM_TYPE it is 40 for ADSL and a higher number (I know there is some kind of logic to this, as in a number higher than XX, but I don't know where to find that...) is for VDSL.

----

Guillaume sent this morning an email with the things they have seen after a couple of days of Stage 1 of the G.INP pilot.

The main problem is that they are finding that 3 days into the stage 1, there are 7 lines were scheduled to change the profile to a non-G.INP profile. The lines in question are:

- Problem from SFR:
432521615
223182838
223206063

- "Issue" from ASSIA
432620263
320094907
320722045
130064883

The first block, marked as problem from SFR, is because the PO is recommending the original profile, which happens to be "the same" as the G.INP profile, but without the last part. Example:

223206063:
- original profile: EXP_M_10016k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR
- G.INP profile: EXP_M_10016k_1024k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::10M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16
- After trying to maximize the EFTR, the original profile is the only feasible option (look at the presentation about G.INP to see how the EFTR maximization works), so it sends the information to the DSLAM to change the profile to EXP_M_10016k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR.
- The DSLAM does whatever it pleases, and it configures the profile to EXP_M_10016k_1024k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::10M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16, so the PO sees that the profile is not consistent, and it assumes that it has been externally changed and removes the lines from PO with STATUS_CODE 660 (Interruption detected:  profile was changed by an external system.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-24]

Taking a look at the lines in Stage 1, we have found that there are 9 lines exited with STATUS_CODE 660, which are the following:

130060702    -- Already spotted before by SFR
134140818
223182838    -- EFTR Maximization
223206063    -- EFTR Maximization
223242961
320090182
432521615    -- EFTR Maximization
432610103
432619220    -- Already spotted before by SFR

The three that passed through the process of EFTR Maximization report a non-G.INP profile, but they still have a G.INP profile and they are reporting EFTR information.

There are another two lines that have status 2 in PORT_INFO, meaning they are no longer active, and exited with code 672 (Line was removed):

320087926
432611968

There are another two lines for which the status is 670 (Line has PO disabled or the flag was updated from true to false.):

130108337
473820609

And another one which exited PO with status 673 (Abort of current PO was requested.):

223155007

From the lines still in PO, there are, today, some lines which are configured with a non-G.INP profile, because of the EFTR maximization:

320094907
320110141
320722045
432620263

And a line that yesterday was in that situation:

130064883

Has return to use the G.INP profile.

Isa has told me about the CURRENT and TARGET thresholds:

- For a profile that is active, different metrics are compared to both the TARGET and the CURRENT thresholds.

- In order for a profile to be considered feasible, it should be above the TARGET thresholds, but not necessarily the CURRENT thresholds.

- In order for the system to recommend a change to a more restrictive (higher rate, lower protection,...) profile, the current profile should be above the CURRENT thresholds. This can be seen as "if you want to go to a more restrictive profile, you MUST do really good in your current state".

After that, we have been talking about the way EFTR is working and we have come to the following conclusions:

- The EFTR Maximization phase is, for some reason, including the original profile as the target profiles, and this may or may not be a good idea.

- In some situations the system is recommending to go back to the original profile, because the G.INP profile is not feasible, that is "OK", I guess.

- In some other situations, the system is recommending the original profile (non-G.INP) versus other G.INP feasible profile, because the throughput is higher for the original profile. But this can be a serious issue, because they are comparing the EFTR of a G.INP profile with ...something, not EFTR, because the non-G.INP profile has no way of calculating the EFTR, so they may be comparing apples and oranges. This happens, at least, with lines:

    320110141 - on 20150425 partition
    130064883 - on 20150424 partition

This can be seen in the table PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO in the record of PROFILE with the content AVG_EFTR_MAXIMIZATION.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-27]

Today most of the lines have exited PO, and only 8 remain in PO_STATE:

STATUS_CODE  NUMBER OF OCCURENCES
600	         81
660	         10
670	         2
672	         2
673	         1

There has been only one more line exiting due to an "external profile change". This may mean, as far as I know, that the bug they had in SFR with the profile names is fixed, or that the lines need to be processed again to see if it really works.

Regarding this, there is a funny thing about the line 320110141. We are in an ongoing discussion with Jeonghun about this line because of the way the EFTR Maximization seems to be working.

The PO keeps recommending the PhyR profile:

EXP_M_8000k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR

instead of the G.INP profile:

EXP_M_8000k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::8M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

because of an allegedly higher EFTR (which makes no sense, as the non-G.INP profile has no information about EFTR).

Apart from that, the system recommends that PhyR profile, but the line remains in the G.INP profile, and the system is not detecting an "eternal profile change", taking the line out of PO with status 660.

Isa has a possible explanation for this:

- If the line is in profile 1, and the PO recommends the profile 2, but it changes to profile 3, then it exits with code 660.
- If the lien is in profile 1, and the PO recommends the profile 2, but the profile remains being 1, then it does not exit because it understands there has been some problem with the profile change.

So now I am going to chech all the lines that are still on PO_STATE, to make sure there are no more in the same situation, and if there are any more, then report them to Guillaume, because there should be some problem with the profile change.

The lines to check are:

130064883:
This line is the EFTR Maximization phase, and it has already changed a couple of times of profile, but it has stayed in EXP_14016k_1024k:Extend_Up-INP1_Dw-INP1_Phy for a couple of days, it may estabilize there.

432611143:
This line is the EFTR Maximization phase, and it has already changed a couple of times of profile, so it may enter the "back'n'forth" routine soon enough.

320708461:
This line is still on the Optimization Phase, and it seemed to be working fine, but there are no POP_O samples since "2015-04-24 07:00:51", so the line is still in PO.

320708205:
This one seems to be running "normally", understood as, it has iterated through several profiles in the Optimization Phase, and it just entered the EFTR Maximization stage tonight.
In fact this one would be interesting to check because it should has a "target list" of several profiles, for instance:

    EXP_16000k_1216k:Extend_Up-INP1_Dw-INP1_Phy
    EXP_18016k_1216k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_18016k
    EXP_16000k_1216k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_16000k
    EXP_14016k_1216k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_14016k
    EXP_12000k_1216k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_12000k

320722163:
This is one example of profile swinging from one G.INP to a non-G.INP back and forth. It has being changing from EXP_8000k_1024k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_8000k to EXP_10016k_1024k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_10016k, and back since 2015-04-23 that it entered the EFTR Maximization stage.

320727151:
It has the profile EXP_M_1504k_480k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1504k_480k_s8_r0_r10_d16 and it has tried to change to EXP_M_1M_320k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1024k_320k_s8_r0_r10_d16 on 2015-04-23, but there are no POP_O samples from that line since "2014-04-22 21:00:30".

320096970:
It has the profile EXP_M_2048k_480k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR, and since 2015-04-21 it has tried to change to EXP_M_1M_320k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1024k_320k_s8_r0_r10_d16, to no avail. In fact, the last POP_O sample available is from "2015-04-22 21:00:14".

320110141:
It has the profile EXP_M_8000k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::8M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16, and since 2015-04-24 it is trying to change to EXP_M_8000k_1024k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR, but no luck.

The lines that have no POP_O samples is because they are **out of service**. This can be seen in ADC_POP_O table, in a field called STATE which can be IS or OOS (easy to guess which is which).

Apart from these lines still in PO, there are 11 lines with the same profile as before entering PO, a non-G.INP profile. A way to get this is with the query:

    select * from po_record where
    line_id in (select line_id from ginp_ramp_up where active_flag = 1 and stage < 2) and
    date_completion > to_timestamp('2015-04-20','YYYY-MM-DD')
    and original_profile like last_profile || '%'
    order by line_id;

And the lines are:

    130060702 -- original: 8000k_800k:max_ADSL; final: same; requested: EXP_M_5376k_640k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::5376k_640k_s8_r0_r10_d16; exit_code: 660.
    130108337 -- This worked fine, but the entry in PO_RECORD was after the profile was already G.INP.
    130181264 -- original: EXP_4096k_640k:Extend_Up-INP2_Dw-INP2_Phy; final: same; requested: same; exit_code = 600 -- EFTR Maximization doing its thing.
    223155007 -- This worked fine, but the entry in PO_RECORD was after the profile was already G.INP.
    320087926 -- line was removed.
    320094907 -- original: link_8000k_800k_T10_32_adsl:Extend_Up-Auto_Dw-Auto_new; final: same; requested: same; exit_code = 600 -- EFTR Maximization doing its thing.
    320097231 -- This worked fine, but the entry in PO_RECORD was after the profile was already G.INP.
    320722045 -- original: EXP_12000k_1216k:Extend_Up-INP1_Dw-INP1_Phy; final: same; requested: same; exit_code = 600 -- EFTR Maximization doing its thing.
    432619220 -- original: EXP_M_4096k_640k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR; final: same; requested: EXP_M_5376k_640k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::5376k_640k_s8_r0_r10_d16; exit_code = 660.
    432620263 -- original: EXP_6144k_640k:Extend_Up-INP2_Dw-INP2_Phy; final: same; requested: same; exit_code = 600 -- EFTR Maximization doing its thing.

[2015-04-28]

Today there are still 6 lines in PO, some of the lines from yesterday exited. The lines OS and the one with the change of profile problem are still there, plus two that are there, just optimizing.

One thing that I have learned today with Isa is that when a line is out of service (OS), sometimes the DSLAM does not report the profile that the line is using in the POP_O samples, but it is always reported in the POP_P samples.

So in the table ADC_POP_P (and its variants) there is always information about the profile that the line has. It also has information about the status of the line, in the field STATE where it has 0s when the line is IS, and 3 when the line is OS.

Another intersting field in ADC_POP_P is the field COUNTER_STATES_FEND which gives information about the G.INP status:

    - 0 -> G.INP enabled
    - 2 -> G.INP counters corrupted
    - 3 -> G.INP inactive

Another thing is that I have seen lines where the profile is not G.INP, but there is information about EFTR in POP_O, and the thing is that, TXMODEDS is what indicates if the line is synchronizing using G.INP or not, and not the presence of EFTR data, because even when TXMODEDS = 0 (not G.INP), there maybe information because it GINPCURRENTETRDS = CURRENTRATEDS.

In order to look at the ADPD and VDPM in ADSL2+ cards that were reporting an abnormally high EFTR, we are going to look at Bouygues, which are supposed to be using the same cards, and see if they are also reporting values that are too high. In order to do this, to ease the process, I am going to send the query over to LucÃ­a, and ask her to run it for me. So I have to prepare it:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-29]

From Stage 2 of the G.INP pilot of SFR, Guillaume has changed the service product of 997 lines, the 1000 intended minus the three following:

    235486405
    297351309
    320591636

which were blacklisted.

I am going to remove these lines, as well as the blacklisted from stage 1:

    '223154627'
    '223256368'
    '320086966'
    '320087935'
    '320094413'
    '320702933'
    '320705686'
    '320708660'
    '320708897'

from the GINP_RAMP_UP table, so that there are no confussions about this:

    delete from ginp_ramp_up
    where line_id in
    ('223154627',
    '223256368',
    '320086966',
    '320087935',
    '320094413',
    '320702933',
    '320705686',
    '320708660',
    '320708897',
    '235486405',
    '297351309',
    '320591636');

Apart from that I have looked at the status of the lines in Stage 2 of the pilot and I have seen that, out of the 997 that formed the pilot:

- 2 lines are already not active:

    562205614
    327438706

- 7 lines have a profile INIT_UNKN and they are in PO but not getting any recommendation:

    141523509
    142425491
    238903194
    296838539
    474218692
    475422971
    558471972

  This INIT_UNKN is set by ASSIA when there is IS POP-O samples available for that line.

- 988 are in PO and they have been recommended a G.INP profile.

================================================================================
=== CALL WITH SFR

- They seem to be seriously concerned about the service product SERENITY, because of the experience some users are having. It seems that the configuration currently set for that product makes the service not too good, and clients are complaining.

- It seems that the stability criteria for this service product may be too strict (the standard used by ASSIA for IPTV services) and the result is that sometimes the customers are not even able to use the product.

- About G.INP, the main issue here is that Guillaume is not able to see a noticeable improvement in the (few) lines that have been in the pilot until now. This may be due to the "in the middle" change we did last week, so probably it is a good idea not to use those 100 lines from stage 1 for the analysis... we will see...

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-04-29]

I have configured the connection in order to be able to look at the DB from Bouygues, and I have seen that the instructions given in:

    http://sharepoint.assia-inc.com/expresse/deployment/customers/bouygues/Misc%20Wiki%20Pages/Production%20Environment.aspx

are not precisely clear, and in fact there are things which are not right, as the user/password required to access the DB. But this is clear and accurate in:

    http://sharepoint.assia-inc.com/expresse/deployment/customers/bouygues/Customer%20Specifc%20Documents/Customer_Credentials.xlsx

In any case, the connection is a bit "complicated":

1.- A tunnel to the jumphost should be established through `kangaroo`.
2.- A tunnel to the DB machine should be established through the jumphost. A user and password needs to be entered for both the jumphost and the DB machine. WARNING: the ssh connection to the jumphost is through the port 221, not the more common 22.

That is pretty much it, although it seems a bit complicated, it is essentially just opening a couple of PuTTY windows in Windows.

I have got the results for the comparison of the ratio (EFTR / SyncRate) for the linecards ADPD and VDPM ADSL in Bouygues, and it is clear that they are working fine there.

The only difference is the card version, which is the R012 in SFR and R010 in Bouygues.

We are going to report this to SFR, so that they can talk to Huawei about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-04]

First thing I am doing is looking at the lines in stage 2 of G.INP pilot to see how they are behaving.

Things I have seen:

672	Line was removed	4
660	Interruption detected:  profile was changed by an external system.	38
670	Line has PO disabled or the flag was updated from true to false.	18
600	Line stable with most desired profile. Exit due to normal PO completion.	851
610	Line unstable.  No further optimization possible without downgrading service.	2

Isa has told me that there is a property (she didn't tell me which) which instructs the optimizer not to downgrade a profile if the SNR margin is too big (>20dB), so maybe that has something to do with the line that is exiting the PO with code 610 but apparently it was just fine.

I have sent Isa an e-mail today with the info I gathered about the two lines that exited PO with STATUS_CODE 610. Here is the contents of this e-mail:

================================================================================
Hola Isa,

Como te he comentado, hay un par de lÃ­neas de la stage 2 que han salido con cÃ³digo 610. Las lÃ­neas en cuestiÃ³n, y su evoluciÃ³n en el sistema, son:

563982916: 
                2015-04-28 -> Entra en PO, estando con perfil EXP_M_3552k_640k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR
                2015-04-29 -> Se le asigna un perfil G.INP EXP_M_4096k_640k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::4M_640k_s8_r0_r10_d16
                2015-04-30 -> Cambia a perfil EXP_M_3552k_640k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::3552k_640k_s8_r0_r10_d16 porque el perfil de 4096k viola los umbrales de:
                                CURRENT/REP/GINP_AVGEFTR/DS
                                TARGET/REP/GINP_AVGEFTR/DS
                2015-05-02 -> Entra en la fase de EFTR Maximization con el perfil con el que estaba (3552k).
                2015-05-03 -> Sigue en el mismo perfil, dentro de la fase de EFTR Maximization. Sale de PO con STATUS_CODE 610.

He mirado y en esta lÃ­nea, no intenta hacer un downgrade, y ademÃ¡s el SNR margin que se recoge en POP_O es de en torno a 7-9 dB en DS.

432819250:
                2015-04-28 -> Entra en PO, estando con perfil EXP_5376k_640k:Extend_Up-INP2_Dw-INP2_Phy
                2015-04-29 -> Se le asigna un perfil G.INP EXP_5376k_640k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_5376k
                2015-04-30 -> Se le asigna un perfil EXP_4096k_640k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_4096k porque el de 5376k no cumplÃ­a el umbral de:
                                CURRENT/REP/GINP_AVGEFTR/DS
                2015-05-01 -> Se le asigna un perfil EXP_3552k_640k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_3552k porque el de 4096k no cumplÃ­a el umbral de:
                                CURRENT/REP/CV/US
                2015-05-04 -> No vuelve a cambiar de perfil y sale de PO sin pasar por la fase de EFTR Maximization, con STATUS_CODE 610.

En este caso, la Ãºltima muestra de POP-O, que es posterior a que la lÃ­nea saliera de PO, sÃ­ tiene un SNR margin de 21.4 dB, pero aun asÃ­ no sÃ© si se corresponde con lo que me has comentado, ya que ya habÃ­a salido de PO. La Ãºltima muestra de POP-O antes de salir de PO tenÃ­a un margen de 18.1 dB, que entiendo que es elevada, pero no son los 20 dB que me habÃ­as comentado.

TambiÃ©n me llama la atenciÃ³n que esta lÃ­nea no llega a entrar en la fase de EFTR Maximization.

Esto es lo que he observado para estos dos casos.

Un saludo,
Juanjo
================================================================================

Isa's reply is simple:

- I was not looking at all the thresholds, I have to look at the fields with DATA_TYPE FEASIBILITY_RESULT, and search for NOT_GOOD values.

- The status 610 is because it reaches the lowest speed allowed for the service product (SP_3P_GINP) and it was not able to stabilize it.

There are 38 lines that exited PO with status 660. Out of this, there is a curious thing:

Line 556570184 is reported to have the same original and last profile, both of which are G.INP. The interesting thing is that there is only one record for this line in PO_RECORD, with DATE_REQUEST "2015-04-30 20:39:52", but there are entries in PROFILE_CHANGE_STATUSCODES with date before that one, and there are also entries in PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO for April 29th.

More interesting things about this line is that is configured with service product SP_2P_PhyR which is non-G.INP, but it is configured with profile EXP_M_18M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::18M_1216k_s8_r0_r10_d16, which is G.INP and TXMODEDS is equal to 2 in the POP-O samples.

For the rest of the lines we have the following, lines that did not enter EFTR Maximization phase:

- 323209781 did not change from EXP_M_1504k_480k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1024k_320k_s8_r0_r10_d16 to EXP_M_1M_320k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1024k_320k_s8_r0_r10_d16

- 237214385 reports in POP-O the profile EXP_M_8M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL::6M_800k_s8_r0_r10_d16 but in PO_RECORD is the profile EXP_M_8M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL, and it should have changed to EXP_M_6144k_800k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::6M_800k_s8_r0_r10_d16. It reports in POP-O the G.INP profile since the very first day it was configured to have the G.INP SP.

- 490271422 reports in POP-O the profile EXP_M_12000k_1216k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL::14M_1216k_s8_r0_r10_d16 but in PO_RECORD is the profile EXP_M_12000k_1216k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL, and it should have changed to EXP_M_14016k_1216k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::14M_1216k_s8_r0_r10_d16. It reports the G.INP profile since the very first day it was configured to have the G.INP SP.

Apart from these three, the other 34 lines that exited PO with status 660, all of them is for the same reason: wrong PROFILE set in the DSLAM, compared to the profile the PO recommended.

    2015-05-04-stage_2_lines_660.xlsx

There are three lines with status 672:

    320645981
    321928834
    387325632

For which it seems that they deactivated the PO during the process.

From the 835 lines that exited the process with status 600, normal execution, 30 of them exited with the same profile as they entered. All of these lines had a non-G.INP profile, so after the PO execution they all had a non-G.INP profile, except for:

321108177
494470891

Which, for some reason, had a G.INP profile to begin with.

I am going to send an e-mail to Guillaume with this information, but first, I am going to activate the collection of GINP information for the lines of the next stage, in case they introduce them today, or tomorrow, to have valid data from the beginning:

    update ginp_ramp_up set active_flag=1 where stage=3;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-05]

It happens that most of the lines that exited PO with a STATUS_CODE 600, and the profile didn't change, so they still have the non-G.INP profile, it was because, for some reason, the PO evaluates the throughput for the non-G.INP profile, and it happens to be higher than the G.INP profile's.

We are going to look for a line in a similar situation which is still in PO, and then run PO in SingleLine mode, so to get a log to send to Jeonghun.

The line that we are going to use is the line 231935141.

We have to be careful, because if we run the SingleLine directly, it will detect a change in CPE, and because of the property:

    stm.check.vendor.id.info.consistency=true

Which is set to true, it will exit PO and start anew. And it will leave a record in PO_RECORD with status code 673. In order to avoid this, before executing the SingleLine, we have to change the property to false, AND REMEMBER TO SET IT TO TRUE after we are done with it.

Well, it seems it worked, I mean that it was taken out of PO, so it should be fine.

On a different note, I have checked the control group used for the G.INP pilot, and I have seen that from the 1000 lines that Guillaume inserted for the stage 2, he changed quite a few of them, and some of them, 9, are in the control group we had selected before:

    select line_id from ginp_ctrl
    where line_id in (select line_id from ginp_ramp_up where stage < 3 and active_flag = 1);

    141329168
    141329218
    320477305
    320137800
    320618990
    344215128
    387185941
    387612696
    474237240

So we are going to delete these lines from the control group (they do not represent a lot, because in the control group there are around 45k lines):

    delete from ginp_ctrl
    where line_id in (select line_id from ginp_ramp_up where stage < 3 and active_flag = 1);
    commit;

And done.

The log I generated for Jeonghun was not useful because there was no new POP-O data for the line, and Jeonghun has told me that there is an option for the PO command line tool that lets you choose the date for the PO run. This way a past run can be repeated to get that information. Information about this can be found in Chapter 10 of the document:

    http://sharepoint.assia-inc.com/expresse/Expresse Training/ASSIA - Profile Optimizer - Internal Release Notes.docx

So I am going to run it for the same line 231935141, but for the 2015-04-02, which is the last day there was a profile change request because there were POP-O samples available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-06]

Guillaume inserted the ~10k lines for the stage 3 yesterday, but there are a lot of replacements, so it is just easier to remove the ones we had there, and insert the new ones.

Additionally, as there had been lots of new lines inserted, I have checked if any of those lines was in the control group, and yes, there 263 lines, which I expeditiously removed.

    DELETE FROM GINP_CTRL WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_CTRL WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 3));

On a different note, Jeonghun has found why the non-G.INP profile is getting a throughput calculation. It all has to do with the moment the profile actually changes, and the moment the PO thinks that profile change.

There is a period, by configuration, which is set to:

    stm.profile_change.start.with.delay=false
    stm.profile_change.start.day.offset=0
    stm.profile_change.start.time=02:00:00
    stm.profile_change.end.time=06:00:00
    stm.profile_change.fixed.timeout=false

So all POP-P samples are invalidated within that window, but outside that window, it will look at the profile found in POP-O samples, and it will change the profile of the POP-P samples to match the one in POP-O.

One question I have is, looking at `stm.properties`, I have seen that the property:

    stm.do.not.use.dcpc.profile.name.correlator.for.popp

Which in SFR's case is set to false, and which supposedly controls the use or not of the correlator. Maybe this can be used to avoid the problem? Check with Jeonghun about this.

Additionally, there is the problem of the POP-P samples including the collections from the two DcPc configured for SFR (one with G.INP and another without). Check with Isa about this, because maybe this is helping ruin the way the POP-P profile name correlator works

I have talked to Isa, and neither that property is going to be of any use, nor the two DcPc are going to be problematic, because the PO is configured (in stm.properties, propertys po.popo.table.name and po.popp.table.name) to use the views that are configured to use, if the line is G.INP, the G.INP samples and not the other ones.

So now, I have to do the following:

- Change the property stm.profile_change.start.time, which currently is configured to 2:00:00, to 00:00:00, so that two more hours are invalidated, but we may avoid the problem of gathering G.INP information for non-G.INP profiles.

- Do this change manually in production and restart PO, using:

    ant po start/stop/restar/status

- Then do things right, create an inner ticket, change it in CVS and voilÃ .

One other thing that Isa has told me is about the *scheduler* files in the config directory in production environment. They include information about the scheduling of the different modules. For example: assia_po_scheduler is used to configure the schedule for PO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-08]

A quick check of the lines in stage 3 of SFR reveals that, from all the lines that Guillaume selected, there are quite some lines that have been deactivated.

All (short) day spent trying to get information from the DB for later processing using pandas, in order to compare the control and trial group for the G.INP pilot for SFR. Without success, by the way...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-11]

- Guillaume replied with the answers from the people of Huawei about the problem we are seeing in ADPD and VDPM cards:

    - Huawei suggests that the way to calculate the EFTR using the error free bits is more complicated than what we are doing (* 64 / 900), but we are using this method with Huawei DSLAMs of different version and it is working perfectly fine.

    - Huawei informs that in newer versions of DSLAMs the EFTR is directly reported, but they mention the version V8R15, and in SFR they have V8R12, so this seems of not much help.

    - They wanted to know if we compared the EFTR with the "line rate" or the "net data rate". I have asked this to Isa, and she has asked it to Iker, and it seems that the DS_SYNCH_RATE that we are using in the ADSL_PE_EST_SL table is the value stored in the field CURRENTRATEDS in the ADC_POP_O table, and it corresponds to the "Net Data Rate" reported by the DSLAM.
    
We have replied asking if they (Huawei) can provide more information about a possible change in the way they report the error free bits, and how they need to be processed to calculate the EFTR when the EFTR is not directly reported by the DSLAM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-12]

Guillaume has sent an email letting us know about an increase in the number of clients calling CRM because of sporadic disconnections. The clients are in the group of lines in Stage 3 of the G.INP pilot.

I have created a temporary table with the information about the lines and the time of the calls TEMP_LINES_WITH_CALLS, and I have checked that the lines are, indeed, in the group of stage 3 lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-13]

I have taken a look at the lines that are still in PO, to see if there were any line with non-G.INP profiles with reported EFTR... And I have found a couple:

386661730
477387935

In both cases, they have a couple of feasible profiles to choose from, one G.INP and another non-G.INP. And the result is that they are in the non-G.INP profile, and both report EFTR, but it is similar and they have the message:

- 477387935: "Averaged DS AVG_EFTR of EXP_10016k_1024k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_10016k: 9216.933333333332 kbps, Averaged DS AVG_EFTR of EXP_8000k_1024k:Extend_Up-INP1_Dw-INP1_Phy: 9214.0 kbps, The current profile is at least as good as the best profile in AVG_EFTR. No profile change is recommended."

- 386661730: "Averaged DS AVG_EFTR of EXP_10016k_1024k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_10016k: 8624.0 kbps, Averaged DS AVG_EFTR of EXP_8000k_1024k:Extend_Up-INP1_Dw-INP1_Phy: 8561.0 kbps, The current profile is at least as good as the best profile in AVG_EFTR. No profile change is recommended."

They stay in there because if the difference is lower than the 3% (hardcoded, according to the documentation I have from the GINP design) it will not change.

I am running PO for the line 386661730, as if it were the "2015-05-10 00:51:39", to see if it is still doing something similar to what happened before we changed the po start time. And I will take a look a the log later.

Regarding the lines that were suffering from sporadic disconnections in SFR, after stage 3 started, we are going to look at the DSLAM with the line that complained the most, 559638246, to get the profiles that it has configured. In order to do so, we are going to force the DcPc to request the profiles from the DSLAM, manually.

The DSLAM corresponding to this line is the 40smh1-i1-1, according to DSLAM_INFO with ELEMENT_ID 9009.

We haven't seen anything special about this, so we are going to, first try to correlate the lines, with the DSLAMs, the CPEs and their versions.

In order to get information about the CPE, we use the table VENDOR_ID_INFO_LATEST, for the line cards, we use the view V_PORTS_LINE_CARD_DATA, which already performs the join between port_info and LINE_CARD_INFO_LATEST.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-14]

- Not just the two lines I saw yesterday, but also some other lines, such as these 19 lines already out of PO have been reporting EFTR with non-G.INP profiles:

    232652137
    468675329
    389503438
    386661730
    389741646
    477387935
    382884504
    556702449
    473388510
    382553219
    322194610
    160743791
    438703881
    559124284
    237269507
    327594407
    327626589
    474213360
    491250618

But it does not happen to EVERY line... this is disturbingly random, for example the line 492280128 behaves as it should.

The two we found yesterday and this one that is behaving alright have the same line card.

- Iker suggests to perform an SNMP walk on 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.31.1.34.1.7.201452544, which means nothing to me... he suggests this OR perform a collection in debug, maybe this is simpler.

The way to perform that snmpwalk is by using the utility with that name `snmpwalk` on the dslam where the line is connected. For the line 477387935, the OID for the SNMP request is that long number, so from the machine where the DcPc is, I run:

snmpwalk -v1 -c rledacd 109.24.60.86 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.31.1.34.1.7.201452544

where rledacd is the community, that can be found in the view V_DSLAMS (in this case the community is the read only community, there is also a community for write access).

I am going to send the result to Iker, but it seems that the DSLAM is already returning the incorrect values, so it seems that the proble is on Huawei side, instead of the DcPc side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-18]

In the table V_PROFILES, there is a field GINP_MODE_DS, which indicates if the profile has G.INP activated or not.

One thing that I have observed today is that maybe, what is wrong with the ADPD and VDPM cards is the DS_SYNCH_RATE and not the DS_AVG_EFTR. My reasoning to say this is that the EFTR is in every case similar to the MAX_RATE_DS of the profile, while the SYNCH rate is consistently an 80% of the MAX_RATE_DS.

I have checked that we are collecting and identifying the correct information from the DSLAM (the synch_rate is the current_rate_ds, obtained through the OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.94.1.1.4.1.2.ifIndex, and the EFTR is "more or less" the MIN_EFTR in the DS (FEND), collected using OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.31.1.34.1.7.ifIndex

The information about these OID can be found in:

    http://rc-build-01.assia-inc.com/dsloExpresse/dcpc/dcpc_snmp/dcpc_huawei_common/mib_description.html

For the Huawei DSLAMs in particular, and in:

    http://rc-build-01.assia-inc.com/dsloExpresse/dcpc/dcpc_snmp/

For different brands in general.

Isa suggested to take a look at a line that has an SNR margin big enough, so that it should be able to synchronize at a higher rate, but it is not doing so, and see if anything comes out of that line in particular.

One such line is 387527814, which has a profile:

EXP_5376k_640k:Extend_1_1_phyr_ginp_5376k

And it is synchronizing at 4242 kbps and it has a margin of 29.6 dB.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-20]

SFR has replied with information from Huawei. They claim that everything is working fine in the DSLAMs, so maybe we are collecting the information incorrectly.

Huawei plays with the following concepts:

- Net Data Rate (NDR)
- Actual Data Rate (ADR)
- Actual Net Data Rate (ANDR)

ANDR is only collected when G.INP is active, and then NDR = ANDR. But the thing is that when G.INP is active, ANDR = NDR > ADR. And from the results we are getting, it seems as if the value we are collecting as DS_SYNCH_RATE is the value of ADR... but I am not sure, and noone knows for sure (or at least they haven't mentioned a thing), so I have directly asked SFR, to ask Huawei about what parameters are offered through SNMP and using which OIDs.

- Regarding the lines with the increased number of calls, I just find nothing in common, other than being ISAM and having the previous product SP_3P_MPEG4_PhyR, but this is not really that important, because MOST of the clients where like that.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-21]

- Yesterday, it seems that Isa and Iker found out that there may be a different OID that should be gathered, instead of 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.94.1.1.4.1.2, and in fact, Huawei has replied with the same information.

According to Huawei (and Iker and Isa), the parameter that should be collected is:

- For VDSL cards:

--- Actual data rate :
Name: vdsl2ChStatusActDataRate  
Type: OBJECT-TYPE
OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.115.1.2.1.1.3
-- Actual net data rate  NDR           <<<<< This is the one to use
Name: vdsl2ChStatusActNetDataRate
Type: OBJECT-TYPE
OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.115.1.2.1.1.18

- For ADSL cards:

--- Actual data rate :
Name: adslAtucChanCurrTxRate         
Type: OBJECT-TYPE
OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.94.1.1.4.1.2
-- Actual net data rate  NDR           <<<<< This is the one to use
Name: hwadslAtucChanActNetDataRate
Type: OBJECT-TYPE
OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.6.31.1.3.1.11

So now they probably should think about changing the DcPc to collect this OID instead of the one that was collected until now.

Apart from this, Isa has found out that there may be a potential reason for thedifferences observed in these counters for the SFR case:

================================================================================
GINP PARAMETERs                                         ------- ADSL -------    --- VDSL ---
                                                        ADPD    VDPM    ISA     VDPM    ISAM
Minimum impulse noise protection against Shine (DMT)	40      40      8       8       8
Single high impulse noise event ratio DS (0.001)        20      20      10      10      10
Minimum impulse noise protection against REIN DS (DMT)  7       7       0       0       0
REIN inter-arrival time DS 0-100Hz 1-120Hz(0~1)         0       0       0       0       0
================================================================================

As it can be seen, the values for the SHINE and REIN protection are different, and maybe that is the source of the "problems".

- After talking to Isa about the lines with increased number of calls we have discovered the following:

    - Most of the lines were those days in PO because they were just configured to do so (some had already exited PO... but those are the least).
    - After the intervention of SFR, turning off the machines, there was a problem with the communication between the DcPc machine and the Application server. This affected the two DcPc differently:
        + The regular DcPc is located in one machine, and the request generator (who instructs the DcPc to perform the collections) is in the Application server, so there were no collections performed from 2015-05-07 thru 2015-05-09 (included).
        + The DcPc responsible for G.INP information collection is in the same machine as the other DcPc, but its request generator is in the same machine, so there were collections, but they couldn't be transfered to the Application server for the PO to use them.
        + After the communication problem was solved, JosÃ© manually transfered the collections that were made (only for the G.INP trial lines), so POP-O, POP-P and PE tables are populated.
        + In any case, it can be seen from the PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO that the PO couldn't find any sample for those troublesome days (2015-05-07 through 2015-05-09).

- This could be a cause of problems for the lines, after the first run of the PO, they were configured with a profile that turned them unstable, but they couldn't change the next day, because that day was the intervention, and the DcPc and the PO were isolated from each other.

- What Isa suggests is to analyze the short term stability (remember it measures the stability during the last 24 hours), from the ADSL_PE_EST_SL table, for the trial lines, to see if there was some problems arising just those days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-26]

Today I met with Isa to talk about Sky, and this is what she told me about the "general information" of the account:

======================
Logica de PO depende del CPE pero no del DSLAM.

Dos tipos de tarjeta lucent dependiendo de mayor o menor INP, y por tanto con diferente lÃ³gica.

Stinger no tiene G.INP.

Servicios son de rangos de velocidades bastante amplios, la lÃ­nea se sincroniza dentro de esos parÃ¡metros, por ejemplo 300k - 24M.

THRILL_SEEKER -> prioridad de velocidad, por tanto menos restricciÃ³n de estabilidad.

UPSTREAM_PLUS -> usar anexo M para usar mÃ¡s bandas para subida y dar mÃ¡s velocidad de subida.

Ninguno de estos dos estÃ¡ aÃºn provisionado.


Â¡Â¡BAJAR EL EXCEL CON LOS PERFILES QUE HAY CONFIGURADOS DEL SHAREPOINT!!


DISEÃO DE PERFILES:

- Algo que hacemos siempre es desacoplar subida y bajada, de modo que puedan ser independientes, que no se baje la bajada porque tenga que bajar la subida, o viceversa.

- Margin despuÃ©s de 2012 estÃ¡ fijado a 6, aunque hay algunos de 3dB para algunos perfiles con mÃ¡s velocidad.

- En ISAM no estÃ¡n desacoplados DS y US por limitaciÃ³n de espacio en el DSLAM para almacenar "service" profiles (256). (spectrum es el mismo para todos).

- Profile Type = {0-4}, [TEORÃA] 0: perfiles del operador no gestionados; 1: perfiles assia no gestionados; 2: perfiles assia gestionados; 3: perfiles  del SR (los virtuales, service recommender); 4: perfiles del operador gestionados.

Herramienta de creaaciÃ³n de perfiles del DcPc usa este campo para saber cuÃ¡les va a cargar. Se pueden categorizar los perfiles (assia u operador) e informar al DcPc si ha de gestionarlos o no.

Se usa G.INP pero no el advanced. La diferencia es que no se monitoriza el EFTR. Esto equivaldrÃ­a al PhyR de SFR. Se puede intentar mirar a ver si tambiÃ©n se aprecia la diferencia entre el synchrate y el rate del perfil.

- Sobre los umbrales, estÃ¡n en modo antiguo, que es un millÃ³n de archivos, en vez de uno Ãºnico. Esto, no obstante, es necesario cuando se quieren poner umbrales que dependan del perfil.


SOBRE LOS PERFILES NUEVOS

Ir echando un vistazo a quÃ© perfiles son (perfiles fast con mÃ¡s granularidad de velocidades) y cÃ³mo se tendrÃ­an que procesar con PO (los archivos de MATLAB deberÃ­an tenerlo en cuenta para generar las t-matrix).
======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-28]

- I have to look at the different things that should be done with Sky, and I have started with the "simplest" one. [SKY-439] Remove no3dBs PO logic for specific G.INP CPE.

- I have seen that this should be done by removing the special treatment of those CPEs from the processing done in the file:

    create_SQL_files_Sky.m

- But additionally it seems that it is used `getSystemConfig_Sky.m` because there are some tests where it is checked if a line cards is of type `NALT-C_GINP_NO3DB`, but I am not sure if this is so, I have to check on this with Isa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-02]

- I am running the SNMP walks that Iker requested in order to check in which units the information is reported by Huawei DSLAMs with the OIDs that we are going to use for the ticket DSLE-12612, and this is what I get:

===================

===================

So it seems that they are being reported in bps, and not kbps.

[2015-06-03]

==========================
meeting with SFR:

Meeting with SFR
- The serenity, gamer and blabla service product they started offering it, and everything seems to be going well. It started last Friday.

    - They have no issue about SFR.
    - About Bouygues they don't have any information.

- They want to start offering those options to clients in Axione (Â¿?) DSLAMs. They want us to check if there is any restriction, if that is going to be any problem. I think these are DSLAMs of some kind of other "operator" that SFR owns.

- They aggree to procceed with the next stage instead of with the rest, just with 10k more.

- In fact, we will apply the fix for the DcPc, and they will wait for a couple of days after that to introduce the lines in the trial.

- In fact, encore, they need to confirm that everything is going well with the calls, meaning normal levels again.

==========================

Regarding what they wanted us to check about Axione:
- Axione is some provider for rural areas, which essentially is not connected directly to DSLE, and they simply provide the files with the collections, and these are loaded into the DB.
- There is no problem if they want to offer those service products to these clients, because they are just like regular lines.
- PO logic depends only on the Service Product and the Line Card, and they have Huawei DSLAMs, with ADPD and ADPF line cards.
- The way to identify Axione DSLAMS, they can be located in DSLAM_INFO using NMS_NAME, which is AXIONE for these DSLAMs.

- I need to remind Sky that we may need confirmation that the profiles we have proposed them are valid.

- Also, we need them to send us the list of CPE to include in the exclusion list for the new table that we need to develop.

- Additionally I need to check if the OID change that we are going to include for SFR does not mess with how the system works in Sky.

I have checked REIN and SHINE parameters for sky, and the results are as follows:

    SELECT SHINE_RATIO_DS, COUNT(*) FROM ASSIA_USER.V_PROFILES
    GROUP BY SHINE_RATIO_DS;
    
    -- NULL 9579
    -- 0    936
    
    SELECT SHINE_RATIO_US, COUNT(*) FROM ASSIA_USER.V_PROFILES
    GROUP BY SHINE_RATIO_US;
    
    -- NULL 10515
    
    SELECT MIN_INP_REIN_DS, COUNT(*) FROM ASSIA_USER.V_PROFILES
    GROUP BY MIN_INP_REIN_DS;
    
    -- NULL 9579
    -- 0    936
    
    SELECT MIN_INP_REIN_US, COUNT(*) FROM ASSIA_USER.V_PROFILES
    GROUP BY MIN_INP_REIN_US;
    
    -- NULL 10515

So, all profiles have values either `NULL` or 0, so the changes should not affect.

------

- I am trying to analyze the advantages of using G.INP for SFR, compared to not using it. In order to do that, I am trying to get the information from the DB, with a query, so that I can share it more easily with the rest of the people, in case of need.

Right now what I am trying to do is to find examples of lines which were stable before the change to G.INP, and that are stable now, but which rate has decreased, and see if that is due to the throughput being better with a lower synchronization rate.

With the following query:

SELECT LINE_ID, AFT.DSLAM_TYPE, AFT.SYSTEMTYPE, BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE, AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE, AFT.DS_AVG_EFTR FROM
  (SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL
  WHERE ESTIMATION_DATE = TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-05-06', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
  WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 3 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
  AND STABILITY < 2) BEF
INNER JOIN
  (SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL
  WHERE ESTIMATION_DATE = TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-06-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
  WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 3 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
  AND STABILITY < 2
  AND DS_AVG_EFTR IS NOT NULL) AFT
USING (LINE_ID)
WHERE AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE / BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE < 0.8;

I can get the lines which were stable on 2015-05-06 (just before the start of stage 3), and were stable on 2015-06-01 (way after the change was done), and for which the after over before ratio of the synch rate is lower than 80%.

There are 1825 lines in this situation, some of them with ISAM, some with HUAWEI. I am going to look into ISAM DSLAMs because for those the problem with the SHINE and REIN parameters is not so accute.

One such line is:

    LINE_ID   DSLAM_TYPE  SYTEMTYPE  BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE AFT.DS_AVG_EFTR
    130931787 ISAM        40         10014             6081              6136

This line started with the profile:

    EXP_M_10M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR

And ended the PO optimization with:

    EXP_M_6144k_800k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::6M_800k_s8_r0_r10_d16

And... it seems that I am fucked, because the PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO no longer has information about the date 2015-05-06 and surroundings, so no luck in getting to know what happened... except that I can run PO manually to see what happened... But that... not today!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-05-09]

- First thing, for me to remember, the table PARTITIONED_TABLES has the information about which tables are partitioned and, additionally, it has information about the number of days that is kept in the DB, the retention days, in the field `HISTORY_DAYS.

As it is specified in `PARTITIONED_TABLES`, the table `PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO` has a retention policy of 20 `HISTORY_DAYS`, which means that we have already lost the information about what did the PO when the stage 3 started... so for the next (and --quasi--final) stage, we have to take this into account, and backup (copying) this table.

Nevertheless, Isa suggested that maybe something can be ... arranged using the information in ADSL_PE_EST_SL as follows:

- On the day the line changed from PhyR to G.INP, take a look at the speed of the EFTR (which has been correct all along), and see if that EFTR increases when the profile changes to lower speeds...

- Next, I have tried the new JAR file for the collections from Huawei DSLAMs that Iker provided. And it is working as expected, with the ETR being lower than the synch_rate, as it should. The way to check which fields are which in the POP-P and POP-O collection, is using the information in:

    http://rc-build-01.assia-inc.com/dsloExpresse/dcpc/dcpc_fileformat/xref/com/assia/dslo/dcpc/fileformat/DcPcPopPOutputFields.html
    http://rc-build-01.assia-inc.com/dsloExpresse/dcpc/dcpc_fileformat/xref/com/assia/dslo/dcpc/fileformat/DcPcPopOOutputFields.html

respectively. This information is also available in the CVS code:

    /cvs/dsloExpresse/dcpc/dcpc_fileformat/src/main/java/com/assia/dslo/dcpc/fileformat/

Now, the change has been done for Huawei, but not for ISAM, so, if they do not manage to fix it for ISAM before we apply the patch, the solution is to change the configuration of the view V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL, so that the fields CURRENTRATEDS and GINPCURRENTETRDS are swapped for ISAM DSLAMs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-10]

-  THINGS TO DO TODAY:

    + Include in a ticket (ask LucÃ­a about this ticket) that there is for the framework (or something like that) the modification of the DcPc part that collects information from Huawei DSLAMs. The ticket is the following:

    https://support.assia-inc.com/jira/browse/DSLE-12234

    + Modify the view so that the fields CURRENTRATEDS and GINPCURRENTETRDS are swapped for ISAM. In order to do so, the information that can be used to differentiate the DSLAM type is the LINE_CARD_TYPE field in the table GINP_RAMP_UP which is being used already.

    ISAM   -> line cards starting with an 'N'.
    Huawei -> line cards starting with an 'H'.

    With this, a CASE WHEN THEN statement can be used in the SQL creation query for the view.

Meeting with SFR:

- We are bad boys, really bad boys, we didn't let them know that we were going to install it in production. And they showed some discomfort.

- They are going to send us the list of lines that they are going to provision tomorrow with the G.INP produts.

- We are confirming them that there should be no problem if they provision new products for Axione lines.

[2015-06-11]

- I am checking if the fix for the Huawei collections and the change in the view V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL are working or not.

There quite a lot of POP-O samples from yesterday, so I am creating a temporary table with the samples with TXMODEDS = 2, to see that the values are more or less correct for lines with G.INP. The table I have created is TEMP_JGARCIA_POP_O.

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_POP_O AS SELECT * FROM V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL WHERE COLLECTION_DATE > SYSDATE -1 AND TXMODEDS = 2;

Using this temporary table I can check if the CURRENTRATEDS is always greater or equal than the GINPCURRENTETRDS for the lines in G.INP:

    SELECT STATE, COUNT(*) FROM
    (SELECT CASE WHEN CURRENT_RATIO >= 1 THEN 'RIGHT' ELSE 'WRONG' END STATE
    FROM
    (SELECT
      GR.LINE_ID,
      TP.COLLECTION_DATE,
      TP.PROFILE,
      TP.STATE,
      SUBSTR(GR.LINE_CARD_TYPE, 0, 1),
      TP.CURRENTRATEDS / TP.GINPCURRENTETRDS AS CURRENT_RATIO,
      TP.MAXRATEDS / TP.GINPMAXETRDS AS MAX_RATIO
    FROM TEMP_JGARCIA_POP_O TP
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP GR
    ON (TP.TN = GR.LINE_ID)))
    GROUP BY STATE;

There are three samples for which the MAXRATEDS / GINPMAXETRDS < 1, but they are 0.99, so it is not really an issue.

- Next we have to check PE results, if DS_SYNCH_RATE >= DS_AVG_EFTR for today. They seem to be right, except that there are some lines (very few of them) which have started to synchronize at a very low speed, but this may be a momentary problem and the PO should take care of them. There are 367 such lines, but only 151 lines have a ratio over 1.02.

I have found another thing, in the GINP_RAMP_UP table, there are some lines which are duplicated, so we have them with the ACTIVE_FLAG set to 0 and 1... so we are getting some samples in the view V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL with and without G.INP information. For example the lines:

    SELECT DISTINCT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM
    (SELECT LINE_ID, COUNT(*) NO_ENTRIES FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    GROUP BY LINE_ID)
    WHERE NO_ENTRIES > 1)
    AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 0;
    
I am going to delete those, because they are already active in another stage, and they are just messing around:

    DELETE FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM
    (SELECT LINE_ID, COUNT(*) NO_ENTRIES FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    GROUP BY LINE_ID)
    WHERE NO_ENTRIES > 1)
    AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 0)
    AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 0;
    
    COMMIT;

After this, I have seen that there is a line: 130903802, which has a G.INP service product, a G.INP profile, GINPCURRENTETRDS in V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL, non null ERROR_FREE_BITS_FEND, but still in ADSL_PE_EST_SL the field DS_AVG_EFTR is set to null... who knows what is happening.

For another line: 140350683, it seems that the PE is using the information from the table ADC_POP_O instead of from the view...

- Guillaume has sent the lines for the next stage, 9941 lines, so in order to have it more or less tidy and neat, I am going to remove the lines that we had configured for stage 4 previously, and then add the new ones.

Just in case I am backing up the lines that we had from before as:

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_GINP_RAMP_UP AS SELECT * FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4;
    COMMIT;

And again, there were some lines (106) in the control group that have been selected as part of this stage of the pilot, so I delete them from the GINP_CTRL table.

    DELETE FROM GINP_CTRL
    WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4);
    COMMIT;

And this should be it... tomorrow I will look at the strange cases, with calm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-12]

Interesting, yesterday Guillaume provisioned a G.INP service product to 9941 lines, but only 5323 were enabled for PO,so only those are in PO_STATE today. The other 4618 have the G.INP product, but they didn't enter PO.

    SELECT IS_PO_ENABLED, COUNT(*) FROM PORT_INFO
    JOIN (SELECT * FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4)
    USING (LINE_ID)
    GROUP BY IS_PO_ENABLED;
    
    IS_PO_ENABLED  COUNT(*)
    1              5323
    0              4618

And from the 5323, 1 of them already exited PO with state 672 (line was removed), because the line has STATUS 2 in PORT_INFO. This line is 545613128.

In any case, the lines that had IS_PO_ENABLED set to 1, they did not have POP-O or POP-P or neither of both samples, so PO has done nothing tonight.

    SELECT PROFILE, COUNT(*) FROM PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO
    PARTITION (P20150613)
    WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM PORT_INFO
    JOIN (SELECT * FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4)
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE IS_PO_ENABLED = 1)
    AND PROFILE LIKE 'NO_PO%'
    GROUP BY PROFILE;

    PROFILE             COUNT(*)
    NO_PO: NULL_POPO	101
    NO_PO: EMPTY_POP_P	5222

I have found yet another strange thing, with line 561485924, which last night it went back to a non G.INP profile, because the G.INP profile was not feasible, but the funny thing is that the non-G.INP profile was also not feasible... what may have happened then is that it has just gone back to the original profile. Just to keep an eye on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-15]

- There is something funky about the lines that are inserted in the next stage of the G.INP pilot for SFR... some of them (3953) don't have POP-P information collected, that seems a bit fishy.

A way to calculate this is using the query:

    SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT LINE_ID, SUM(ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND) ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND FROM
    (SELECT
      LINE_ID,
      CASE WHEN ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND
    FROM ADC_POP_P PARTITION (P20150615)
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP ON TN = LINE_ID
    WHERE STAGE = 4
    AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
    GROUP BY LINE_ID)
    WHERE ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND = 0
    ;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-16]

- Nothing has changed, but it seems that today there were much less lines without G.INP information in the POP-P collections, just 89.

- Still, it is strange... let's see what happens in the collection that should happen around 1pm today, but it is super fishy.

- For example, line 232548419, has the G.INP service product, buuuuut, it does not have any POP-P collection with G.INP data, so there is no data in the view, and the PO uses the view, so no processing for that line, so no profile change.

- Line 559692826 has TXMODEDS = 2, and has POP-O samples with GINPCURRENTETRDS, and it had one POP-P sample with ERR_FREE_BITS_FEND on 2015-06-12, but not any more. Strange as it should be...

- To top it all off... 9888 lines have G.INP data in the POP-P samples after today's collection, so it just doesn't make any sense... at all.

- Today, after the last PO execution, there were:

    + 9941 lines in GINP_RAMP_UP for the stage 4 of the pilot.
    + 8525 lines in PO_STATE.
    + 1089 lines in PO_RECORD.
    + 9601 lines have the IS_PO_ENABLED flag set to 1. Which is difficult to put together with the fact that the sum of lines in PO_STATE plus the lines in PO_RECORD is 9614... there should be some repeated lines, in both tables...

- OK, there is a line, 491263229, which exited PO with code 673 (*), so this one went back to PO_STATE.
(*) Abortan la ejecuciÃ³n de PO para esa lÃ­nea a travÃ©s de la NAPI, o cuando se detecta un cambio de tarjeta o de vendor_id (pero esto del vendor_id en SFR estÃ¡ desactivado), (en este caso se sale y vuelve a entrar, con source = 4)

- This is just a mess... but at least today they worked... let's see what happens tomorrow...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-17]

- For some reason, today all the POP-P samples had G.INP information, as it should be, so it really seems that it was something strange that happened those days... Too suspicious, to be honest.

- Apart from that, today we have:

    + 6691 lines in PO_STATE.
    + 2923 lines in PO_RECORD.

- Funny thing is that from the lines, allegedly in the stage 4 of the pilot, today there are more lines than yesterday with the PO disabled, which I just don't understand fully, but anyway:

    IS_PO_ENABLED   STATUS  COUNT(*)
    -------------   ------  --------
    1               0       9553
    1               2       39
    0               0       345
    0               2       3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-18]

Today POP-P normal, again... but probably something can be seen in the data, when I am ready to get some KPI for the analysis... we will see.

I keep on looking at the realease from Sky, to see how to do it...

- Something to get from the Systems Engineering is that if I need information about the standards, I can contact kkerpez@assia-inc.com.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-24]

- After modifying the m-files for the generation of the profiles and the t-matrices for the new release of Sky, I am going to start with the build process.

    1. The `profiles_lineprofiles`... and success!
    2. config/stm ... without the sql, which I haven't modified yet... and success!

I have created the tables:

    TEMP_JGARCIA_PE_TRIAL
    TEMP_JGARCIA_PE_CTRL

with the following queries:

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_PE_TRIAL AS
    SELECT *
    FROM
      ADSL_PE_EST_SL
    JOIN
      GINP_RAMP_UP
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1
    AND ESTIMATION_DATE > TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-05-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
    COMMIT;

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_PE_CTRL AS
    SELECT *
    FROM
      ADSL_PE_EST_SL
    JOIN
      GINP_CTRL
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE ESTIMATION_DATE > TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-05-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
    COMMIT;

This way next queries are much faster. I use this for the comparison of the GINP trial lines and the control group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-25]

- I am going to back up the information in PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO for the lines in the trial, so that later, I can look at what were the reasons for the profile changes, hopefully, helping us sell the G.INP to SFR.

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RI_20150614 AS
    SELECT * FROM PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO
    PARTITION (P20150614)
    JOIN
    GINP_RAMP_UP
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1;
    COMMIT;

I change the dates from 20150611 till today (20150625).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-26]

- In order to make the modification for the ticket SKY-390, creating the exclusion list for the CPE not supporting (or not using) G.INP, I have to create a new table, and a new view.

- These changes imply generating a couple of SQL scripts, and then these scripts should be included in the `pom.xml` of the `releases/sky/sky_db/`.

- One thing that I have observed here is that the Maven task will just append the files that are specified there in the blocks `<concat>`, but they are concatenated directly, this means that the contents of a file will be placed IMMEDIATELY AFTER the contents of the previous, without new line or anything.

- This should be taken into account to make sure that the end of a file is not affecting the begining of the next one, for example a file ending with a line:

    --

will affect the next file, because it will comment the first line, so make sure that there are blank new lines in each file so that it does not interfere with the next file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-29]

- It happens that for version 3.7 onwards, the validation of the profiles checks that for ISAM DSLAMs, the FEC delay cannot be 0, and for FAST profiles, it should be set to 1ms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-06-30]

- One thing that may be interesting to remember is in order to prepare a Release:

    - SQL
    - Profiles
    - Tmatrices
    - Thresholds
    - <customer>_db

- Another thing is, when committing SQL files, they should be inserted in CVS as ASCII, not as binary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-01]

First I am going to make the backup of the following PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO tables, corresponding to the period (inclusive) 2015-06-26 - 2015-07-01.


- I have setup the keys between lexus and rc-cvs-01 so that I can ssh from one to the other without password, easing the process of updating the CVS and building the release_generator. The instructions in:

http://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/

Although they may be in so many other web sites as well.

After performing the build in lexus, I can proceed to install and launch all the modules in Jenkins:

http://rc-build-01.assia-inc.com:8080/view/DSL%20Expresse%20Group/view/Nightly%20deployments/job/Sky_Nightly_Deployment/

Where a nightly build can be started, and the status of this build can be checked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-02]

- I happens that the nightly build failed because of a couple of things:

    - I didn't update the STM version in the `pom.xml` file of the `release_generator` to the correct version, in this case `4.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.
    - When placing the `globals.properties` for the PO only, it has to be a complete file where, amongst other things, it specifies that the profiles are read from the DB instead of the XML files, and several other things.

With all that, that ialmandoz kindly did for me, the build worked fine.


-- From Systems Engineering meeting today:

If we have a single leg bridge tap at a given position, what would be the diagnosis of SELT, DELT and MELT? send the answers by e-mail to ... whomever posed the question, I have to find out who he is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-03]

I am looking at the lines in the G.INP pilot of SFR, searching for lines whose speed has decreased after entering the pilot.

    SELECT LINE_ID, AFT.DSLAM_TYPE, AFT.SYSTEMTYPE, BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE, AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE, AFT.DS_AVG_EFTR FROM
      (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL PARTITION (P20150611)
      WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
      AND STABILITY < 2) BEF
    INNER JOIN
      (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL PARTITION (P20150626)
      WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
      AND STABILITY < 2
      AND DS_AVG_EFTR IS NOT NULL) AFT
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE / BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE < 0.7;

When I have some lines like this, I look at individual lines, and see if the transitions through profiles, reducing the rate, is motivated by not meeting the requirements for the throughput.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-06]

- For the KPI analysis for SFR, the idea is to find lines that have a lower `DS_SYNCH_RATE` after the run of the PO, but they have a higher `DS_AVG_EFTR`.

- The catch here is that before the lines were provisioned with the G.INP product, they didn't report EFTR, so what we are going to assume is that the EFTR for the PhyR profile was "more or less" the same of the first G.INP profile configured for the line.

- So, with this query we find the lines that have a lower rate profile after the PO, and store their `LINE_ID` in a temporary table:

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_1 AS 
    (SELECT LINE_ID FROM
      (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL PARTITION (P20150611)
      WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
      AND STABILITY < 2) BEF
    INNER JOIN
      (SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL PARTITION (P20150626)
      WHERE LINE_ID IN (SELECT LINE_ID FROM GINP_RAMP_UP WHERE STAGE = 4 AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1)
      AND STABILITY < 2
      AND DS_AVG_EFTR IS NOT NULL) AFT
    USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE AFT.DS_SYNCH_RATE / BEF.DS_SYNCH_RATE < 0.9);

- Next, the idea is to find which lines have a higher `DS_AVG_EFTR` after the PO ran. For this the following query finds, for each line, the first (oldest) `DS_AVG_EFTR` and the last (newest) `DS_AVG_EFTR`, so that later this information can be used to find the interesting lines:

    SELECT LINE_ID,
    AVG(DS_AVG_EFTR) KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY ESTIMATION_DATE) INITIAL_EFTR,
    AVG(DS_AVG_EFTR) KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY ESTIMATION_DATE) FINAL_EFTR
    FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL JOIN TEMP_JGARCIA_1  USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE DS_AVG_EFTR IS NOT NULL
    AND DS_AVG_EFTR <> -1
    GROUP BY LINE_ID;

- I have consolidated all the TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RI_XXXXX tables into a single table, so that it is easier to analyze later on. The table is TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RECOM

- So I am going to insert the information corresponding to the information until today, i.e., from 2015-07-03 to 2015-07-08 (Partition dates).

- And I am going to remove the other tables.

- One thing that I have observed in SFR is that there are no more cases of the situation found in DSLE-12533, where a line, after being working with G.INP, upon returning to PhyR, would report G.INP data (corresponding to the last information gathered while it still was G.INP).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-08]

- In the call with SFR today, Guillaume has mentioned some things:

    + It seems that lines with low rates (<1M) are having their rates reduced even further, take a look at them. They should not be lines in the pilot, because G.INP is not used for lines with such low DS rates.
    + They want a report where we can show them the good aspects of G.INP applied to SFR case. They need to sell it, so the more we can help them, the better.
    + It seems that they want to add a new operator (whatever that means). It was something they talked back in the day, but was in stand by, and it seems that now, the project has seen the light. And for this they need us to send them what information is necessary to include a new operator in ASSIA system.

- Isa has found that in the G.INP tmatrices of SFR, the last profiles in the transitions are duplicated, so I need to take a look at that...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-13]

- The other day, after changing the tmatrices of SFR, and trying to build in lexus the `release_generator`, I had a problem, and Iker told me that it had to do with:

https://support.assia-inc.com/jira/browse/DSLE-12769

Essentially, it won't build with Java 8, so we should manually set it to use Java 1.6

During the preparation of the release for Sky, in the log that QA provided, an error was logged:

Where it explains that there is a table which is not found, the table PO_SUCCESS_PREDICTOR.

There is a couple of properties in the file `stm.properties`:

    po.realtime.evaluate.success.predictor.feasibility [default=false]
    po.realtime.success.probability.threshold [default=0.0]

Which are not changed for Sky, so it seems that they are not using it, so it should be the case that the "error" is not so serious.

Apparently we can check what scripts were used at different stages to create the DB, in the table EXPRESSE_SCHEMA_VERSION.

- I have included the information of PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO tables in the TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RECOM until today (partition 20150716).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-21]

- I have included the information of PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO tables in the TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RECOM_until today (partition 20150722).

- I think I am going to create an index in this temporary table, because it is starting to grow big (1155534 records today), and it may make it easier to find whatever we are trying to get from it, and by easier I mean faster.

    CREATE INDEX POR_LINE_ID_IDX ON TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RECOM (LINE_ID);

Because the information in this table is intended to be used when looking at particular lines individually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-23]

- After inserting yesterday the lines for the next stage in the pilot, there were a couple of lines that have already got out of PO with status code:

    639	DSL standard not supported by PO.

These lines, '160960025', '494384106', have SYSTEMTYPE 40, which is ADSL2+, pretty normal, so it doesn't make much sense, and PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO does not shed much light over it, so what I am going to do is run PO in singleLine mode for one of the lines and take a look at the log, to see if I can spot anything fishy.

And it shed light on it: there are POP-O samples where the SYSTEMTYPE appears to be -1, which is not valid. I asked a question to the people in California, hoping that they may know something about that.

- Guillaume sent and e-mail today about a line: 130042161, which appears to have no data between the dates 2015-07-09 and 2015-07-17, but according to Guillaume there is information in the database. We have looked into it using these queries:

    SELECT * FROM HIST_PORT_INFO
    WHERE LINE_ID = '130042161'
    ORDER BY LAST_UPDATE_DATE DESC;
    
    SELECT * FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL
    WHERE LINE_ID = '130042161'
    AND TRUNC(ESTIMATION_DATE) >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND TRUNC(ESTIMATION_DATE) <= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-17', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ORDER BY ESTIMATION_DATE DESC;
    
    SELECT * FROM V_ADC_POP_O_GINP_TRIAL
    WHERE TN = '130042161'
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) <= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-17', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ORDER BY COLLECTION_DATE DESC;
    
    SELECT * FROM V_ADC_POP_P_GINP_TRIAL
    WHERE TN = '130042161'
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) <= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-17', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ORDER BY COLLECTION_DATE DESC;
    
    SELECT LINE_ID, COLLECTION_DATE, STATUS_CODE, CODE_DESCRIPTION FROM DCPC_STATUS_CODE A
    JOIN STATUS_CODES_DESCRIPTIONS B
    ON (A.STATUS_CODE = B.CODE_NUMBER)
    WHERE LINE_ID = '130042161'
    AND CODE_TYPE = 'DcPc'
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND TRUNC(COLLECTION_DATE) <= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-07-17', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND CODE_DESCRIPTION LIKE 'POP_%'
    ORDER BY COLLECTION_DATE DESC;

And the conclusion is simple: This line was either out of service during this period, or the data that the DSLAM reported was inconsisten, and the samples were rejected. As a result, there is no (valid) information to show in the GUI.

A problem here is that we cannot know the reason for that inconsistency, because the logs of the DcPc (whose location can be found in the `log4j.properties` of the DcPc) are periodically deleted, and we have no information about those days anymore. (The policy is defined in the `log4j.properties` file, and it is configured to generate a new file when the current one reaches 100MB, and to keep only 20 files of the log).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-24]

- Looking at the lines in the stage 5 of the G.INP pilot of SFR, I have seen that there is a line that exited PO with code: 663	Exit due to exit action in transitions. The particular line is 145981081, and it seems that:

    + On 2015-07-22 the G.INP product was provisioned.
    + On 2015-07-23 a PhyR product was provisioned for the same LINE_ID, but with a different CIRCUIT_ID (in HIST_PORT_INFO). I am not sure what this means, but it looks suspicious, a bit too suspicious, to be honest.

- What I think it hapened is that the G.INP line and service product were overwriten by someone who restored the previous non-G.INP service product, and they changed the CIRCUIT_ID... for some reason.

- And a new line appeared with the same "problem" of a DSLAM reporting a SYSTEMTYP -1, which essentially screws all the optimization process.

- I asked Jeonhung about this and his reply was:

    "System type -1 means the system type is not identifiable. System type is
    crucial information in many algorithms, including MABR estimation. PO's
    approach to making a profile change is rather conservative; if any of the
    collected system type of the line is one of the disabled (or unsupported)
    system types, PO wouldn't touch the line because doing so may put the line
    in an unexpected situation."

So there you go, conservative approach, and now we need to wait for five days for the system to not consider that "corrupted" sample.

- In order to make it easier to build the graph from the collections reports, as it was needed yesterday, I have written a small python script that will look at the collections reports (downloaded using another script, this one got from the web, and just slightly modified, in VBA) and gather the information requiered to be able to insert that information in a spreadsheet for further modification (or mainly plotting purposes).

- Interestingly, in the collections reports there is also a breakdown of the information per DSLAM type, and it seems to happen that MOST of the lines with the 110 code are for ISAM DSLAMs connected to the NMS `TL1_Isam`.

- Additionally, LucÃ­a has told me that for SFR we are not using `V_DSLAMS` view,but `V_DSLAM_INFO_SFR_DCPC` instead.

- More random knowledge: TL1 is another protocol for gathering management information, pretty much like SNMP, but usually for old DSLAMS (in theory... this is yet to be proved).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-07-03]

- After vacations, I have found that SFR is almost dead, as in, they are not giving any sign of being alive... that can be good or it can be bad... who knows.

- Sky, on the other hand, is back in business with Steve Wilson, who seems to be a very active ticket-creator-instigator. He has a couple of questions that may be interesting:

    + SKY-444: He wants a crude estimate for the impact of the new fast profiles on the retrains. Well ... we can give an upper bound, given by the lines that currently are unstable because of retrains and CVs in US. At most, these are the lines that may benefit, but this is not a guarantee that they are going to improve.
    + SKY-445: He wants to know if we can provide more information about how the PO decides what profile from the t-matrix is assigned based on the priority socres. We have no "priority scores" except for the order in the t-matrix entries. They can always look at the PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO table, but this table is more for internal debugging use, than for regular use, and we are not going to be spending a lot of time explaining in detail all the information that can be found there, maybe some examples.

- In any case, after talking to Steven on the phone the following is what I get from it:

    + He has a "concern" about the profiles, and that is why he has been asking: he has been doing some kind of quick analysis (he will upload this information to the tickets for us to review) and it seems that there is some "shift" in the profile distribution from 32/4 profiles (for non-G.INP) to 16/2 (for G.INP) profiles, and it also seems that 16/2 users are showing a slightly higher number of retrains (on average).
    + He has also mentioned something about some profiles that they were pushing into a given speed, and then PO was turning back into the original speed, some kind of loop, that is not good, but I am not sure about what ticket he was talking about (something about the retrain increase in April, but not sure which one it was.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-04]

- Well, as it happens, there should always be problems, and now, as it couldn't be any different, in SFR, for the stage 5 we had a problem:

    The day 2015-07-28, it seems that the machine where the DcPc runs was rebooted, and there are init.d scripts for each module, except for the G.INP DcPc... so since that day, there had been no DcPc collections with G.INP information, which means that there are no data collected from 2015-07-28 till 2015-08-04. And this is delaying EVEN MORE the next stage.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-05]

- I have been talking to Steven Wilson about the problems they are facing, and the tickets he opened SKY-444 and SKY-445. The bottomline of what they are worried about, and what they want, is:

    + It seems that they had, some years ago, a fever to get higher and higher rates.
    + Nowadays, it seems that this fever has shifted towards worrying about the retrains of a line, and the customer complaining for that. The bottomline of what they are worried about, and what they want, is:

    + It seems that they had, some years ago, a fever to get higher and higher rates.
    + Nowadays, it seems that this fever has shifted towards worrying about the retrains of a line, and the customer complaining for that.

And that is the reason for all the spreadsheets that he has uploaded to the tickets, and all the "complicated math" that he has used there.

So there are a couple of things:

- Concern about an increasin number of lines that have gone from `very stable` to `stable`, because maybe the reason for this change were the retrains, but the line is stable, so maybe the system is not moving back to a more stable profile with less (hopefully no) retrains. The thing is that there are lots of `stable` lines, and despite they have a small average number of retrains, it seems that they have a very strong impact on the overall average number of retrains (this is something that I don't quite get... he calculated this influence as:

               average number of retrains * number of lines for that class
               -----------------------------------------------------------
                            total number of lines in the system

But there is something I don't quite concur with. First he is just looking at averages, and that is hiding a lot of information. Much better option would be to look at distrubution of number of retrains and see how is it distributed, in order to see if there are some subset of lines with an abnormally high number of retrains, while the others remain more or less a "normal" levels.

- The other thing is that Steven is slightly worried that with the new profiles that are going to be included things are going to get worse, in terms of retrains. Not that it is the case, but maybe it could happen, with users with 1120kbps interleaved profile potentially changing to a 1120kbps fast profile.

So essentially what he wants to know, or have information about, is:

- Thresholds for the new fast profiles to go up or down (which are the thresholds for MABR or for CVs). With this he can probably find a "crude estimate" for the potential impact of the new profiles in the system.
This information is in the threshold files, in particular in the "cur_rrdc_us" files, yeah, quite a cryptic name for that, but the description of which is which can more or less be found in the Systems document for the account of Sky.

- He wants to know if there is any possibility for a line that has gone to a G.INP profile to go back to a non-G.INP profile (without changing the service product), maybe by tunning some LEFTR thresholds or something.

OK, apart from that he has told me that they are in the process of pushing some lines into PO in order to try to improve them. In particular, they have gone through different phases:

- First lines which were CVU (consistently very unstable) -> they pushed them into PO and everything went great, lines stabilized.
- Then lines that had DS rate under 1M -> they pushed them into PO and everything went great, lines got a higher DS rate.

And now they are doing this to lines with a DS rate between 1 and 2 megabytes, but they are observing that the number of retrains is increasing (they seriously have an issue with the retrains).

He has shared with me the query they use to select the lines (in the ticket SKY-445), and he has also sent me a query that he has been running and with which he has found that there are some lines that have been pushed into PO a lot of times, but they essentially entered PO and exited without much change.

    SELECT LINE_ID, STATUS_CODE,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SOURCE = 0 THEN 1 END) NEW_LINE,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SOURCE = 1 THEN 1 END) LINE_INFO_UPDATE,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SOURCE = 2 THEN 1 END) CALL_CENTER_REQUEST,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN SOURCE = 3 THEN 1 END) PERF_EVAL,
    COUNT(*) AS TOTAL,
    AVG(NUM_ITER),
    AVG(NUM_PROF_CHG),
    MIN(TRUNC(DATE_REQUEST))
    FROM ASSIA_OWNER.PO_RECORD
    GROUP BY LINE_ID, STATUS_CODE
    ORDER BY TOTAL DESC
    ;

As it happens, a lot of these lines exit the PO with status 652, which is some problem with missing information in POP-O data, I will need to look into this a bit more.

We had also the meeting with SFR, and it seems that they are going to insert the rest (~15k) of the lines in the pilot tomorrow Thursday, and with that the only thing remaining would be just to generate the report for Guillaume to "sell" it.

Guillaume has mentioned a couple of important points to stress:

    - Show that G.INP is better than PhyR.
    - VDSL cards in SFR are already using G.INP, so show that the ASSIA optimized version of the G.INP is better than the regular one.

He hopes we can discuss the report in the next meeting, in two weeks time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-07]

- It seems that after talking to Steven the other day, Steven has not talked to
Emrah, so the latter has asked in the SKY-445 if I have any update on the
questions that I already discussed with Steven.

- In any case I have taken a look at the questions, in particular at the two
profiles mentioned in SKY-440:

    4096_800_16_16_2_2:2P__60_60_0_0::GINP_4096_8_2
    6144_800_16_16_2_2:2P__60_60_0_0::GINP_6144_8_2

The interesting thing is that they have "different INP/delay" values for the
profile and the RTX profile... looking at the code, it actually seems that there
is something fishy in the code when creating the name of the profiles, because
according to the specification I have in the Systems Document for the account,
and the comments in the m-files, the only combinations that are used for G.INP
are the 16/2 and the 8/1, but in the DB there are 16/1 and 8/2 combinations,
although only for the RTX part (the part after the `::`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-10]

- Emrah is worried about the thresholds that have been used for the new fast profiles. The thing is that the thresholds are not the same as the ones specified in ticket SKY-443, but these thresholds were configured for _interleaved_ profiles, while the _fast_ profiles were modified in an earlier ticket, SKY-379.

- He was also worried about the thresholds that we have used being too restrictive, but it is the case that they are, in fact, less restrictive, for a line to stay at a given profile (target):

    fast:        95% US CV <= 100 AND 75% US CV <= 20
    interleaved: 95% US CV <=  50 AND 75% US CV <= 20

For a line to move up (current):

    fast:        95% US CV <= 40 AND 75% US CV <= 10
    interleaved: 95% US CV <= 20 AND 75% US CV <=  0

- Guillaume finally sent the lines for the next stage of the pilot, and I am introducing them, with `stage=6`.

Of course, there are lines in the new batch that were in the control group:

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM GINP_CTRL
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE STAGE = 6;

yields a total of 3927 lines in the control group that have been added now to the pilot so, time to remove them :)

    DELETE FROM GINP_CTRL
    WHERE LINE_ID IN
    (SELECT LINE_ID
    FROM GINP_CTRL
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE STAGE = 6);
    
    COMMIT;

Which leaves us with the following figures for the control and the trial groups:

    Pilot:   45734 lines
    Control: 40199 lines

Now I have to think about this and gauge if it is worth adding new lines to the
control group or not, because maybe it is a fair comparison, as not all the
lines in the pilot are actually useful, but only the last three stages,
accounting for ~35k lines... But this will be a decision for tomorrow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-11]

- In the process of configuring the conection to VIVO, in case I am not connected to the ASSIA network, it is necessary to use the jumphost:

    fe-01.hosted.assia-inc.com

for which the user and password are those `user` and `password`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-12]

- It happens that I had an error in the PO_SERVICE_TYPE_MAP initialization
script, because I commented out, by accident, one of the INSERT statements, in
particular the one that affects the lines with the product DLM_L_20080826, and
that meet the criteria to have the CPE_SERIAL_NUMBER equal to NO_GINP. I have
done the following query in production:

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
    (SELECT * FROM V_PORTS_LINE_CARD_DATA
    WHERE SERVICE_PRODUCT = 'DLM_L_20080826')
    JOIN
    VENDOR_ID_INFO_LATEST USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE VENDORID_FIELD2 != 'B500545354430000'
    AND VENDORID_FIELD1 IN ('44:53:4C:2D:32:36:34:30:53:5F:32:2E:30:34:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00',
    '44:53:4C:2D:32:36:34:30:53:5F:32:2E:30:34:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00')
    ;

and there are only 3599 lines affected.

The line that was commented out in the file:

    sky_po_service_type_map-initialize.sql

was the following:

INSERT INTO PO_SERVICE_TYPE_MAP (dslam_type, service_type,LINE_CARD_TYPE, LINE_CARD_VERSION, CPE_SERIAL_NUMBER, tmatrix, thresholds, weights, force) VALUES ('ISAM','DLM_L_20080826','UNKNOWN','UNKNOWN','NO_GINP','DLM_H_20080826_ISAM_NALT-C.csv','ISAM','weightsAll.txt',0);

I have told Emrah, and now let's see what happens next.

I am going to open an internal and external ticket for this (SKY-446).

And the change has been uploaded to CVS, by just uncommenting this problematic
line. And I am trying test it locally (done), and lexus (done).

- On a different note, and regarding a comment from Emrah in one of the tickets, I realized that I had no idea about what the instability reason means, so I asked Iker (duh...), and he replied this:

--------------
diagnostics.stability.reason.-001=Unable to evaluate stability
diagnostics.stability.reason.000=N/A - The line is stable.
diagnostics.stability.reason.001=High average retrain per day is the cause for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.010=Large US CV count is the cause for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.011=Large US CV count and high average retrain per day are the causes for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.100=Large DS CV count is the cause for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.101=Large DS CV count and high average retrain per day are the causes for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.110=Large DS CV count and large US CV count are the causes for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.111=Large DS CV count,large US CV count and high average retrain per day are the causes for instability.
diagnostics.stability.reason.-1=Unable to evaluate stability
--------------

Essentially it means that they represent three flags, and they take the value 1 or 0 depending on it being active or not:

    <high DS CV> <high US CV> <high retrains>

And additionally the value -1 to represent that it was not possible to evalue
the stability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-17]

- I have to check how the final stage of the SFR G.INP pilot is going, and I am
starting to think that maybe I don't need all the historic data from the rest of
the stages... because that is probably taking a shit load of space.

- Apart from that, it happens that *a lot* of lines are in PO because they have
had no POP-P collection since three days ago... When I say *a lot* I mean that
9459 lines are still in PO, and the last profile changed happened before
2015-08-14 (exclusive).

- I am running a query to get what is the last profile change date for the lines
in the last stage, using:

    SELECT GRU.LINE_ID ||',' || MAX(POPP.COLLECTION_DATE)
    FROM V_ADC_POP_P_GINP_TRIAL POPP
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP GRU
    ON (POPP.TN = GRU.LINE_ID)
    WHERE GRU.STAGE = 6
    GROUP BY GRU.LINE_ID
    ;

- In the meantime, while this runs, I am going to look at the change in the
logic that Emrah is asking for. Sina is more or less not down for the inclusion
of this logic, although he says it can be done, but his opinion is that the
logic should be changed to "not mixing" G.INP with _interleaved_ profiles. I
proposed this to Sky, and now, let's see what they think about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-18]

- In SFR there are strange things with the lines, there are lines for which
there are POP-P collections, from the regular DcPc, but not from the DcPc that
collects the G.INP information, so for these lines there has not been a profile
change for some time now.

    SELECT * FROM PO_STATE
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE STAGE = 6
    AND DATE_LAST_CHG_CMPL < TO_TIMESTAMP('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ;

There are 4593 lines in this situation.

------------------------------
- I will be inheriting the SUNRISE account, and Sina officially told me that
this morning. It seems that it is a pretty straightforward account, with not much work in it. The thing is that the systems engineer that had this account was
one of the guys that was let off last week, so now I will be dealing with it,
witht the help of Mohammad Shahmohammadi <mshahmohammadi@assia-inc.com>, that
apparently worked with that account too, so he may know what is happening here.

- One of the things that Sina mentioned is that there may not be a systems
document for the account, and if there is, it may be quite out-dated, so it
would be a good opportunity to either create it, or update it.

- Things to consider are:
    + They have two different systems, one for data, and one for IPTV, and that
      means that they have different stability criteria for each of those sets.
    + Apparently they had a couple of tricky issues: first it seems that CV were
      not reported (somewhere) and so they needed to make some conversion from
      ES (Error Seconds) to CVs. Secondly, some DSLAMs reported the same
      information for the DS and the US (wtf?!).

- They have talked, sometime, about a potential upgrade to use the advanced
G.INP functionality, but nothing is settled now, so no worries about this.

- I have to be extra careful with the configuration creators: I have to check
that the config creator that is in CVS is actually generating the configuration
committed to the CVS for the release that is in place (or may be in place). In
essence I need to check that the config creator in the CVS is updated, and if
not I may need to talk to someone, to see if they can snatch the updated version from the guy they fired last week.

------------------------------
We had a call with Emrah and Steven about SKY-445, where they asked to have
32/4 profiles included in the PO logic for G.INP enabled CPEs, to which we
suggested to "fuck off" and to avoid mixing things.

Sina is pretty good at this and he has talked them into reason, and showed them
that it would be benefitial (he has to send them some document with results from
other accounts, Bouygues, for them to discuss internally). They are eager to
look at the benefits, discuss them, and then maybe opt for a new release for
mid-November or so, where we can prepare the new profiles and logic, with no
INP and G.INP profiles mixed.

Things that I have to keep from here are:

- If you want to assess numerically what could be the benefits from using a
given configuration of G.INP versus another, it is necessary to have accurate
information about the noise, to have some "noise monitoring system" (whatever
that is). But even then, it can be really tricky to analyze.

- The recommendation, from ASSIA is to avoid "patches" in the sense of changes
of PO logic by just modifying the t-matrix files, for example. Instead we should
recommend the instalation of the full package. In any case, this is just a
recommendation, instead of a hard restriction. "hot fixes" are completely doableand they are actually done, but they are probably not the "best practice" we
can recommend.

- An interesting question by Steven was "why 28ms for the maximum delay in G.INP
 and not any other value"? The reason for this is:
    + We wanted to have more than the 3 retransmissions that we can manage with
      16ms, we canted 5, and the RTT is more or less 5ms.
    + Why not 25 then? Well, some oddities were observed in some CPEs when the
      maximum delay for G.INP was not configured to be a multiple of 4. Oddities
      being a serious performance hit, probably due to implementation details
      in the CPE. That is why 28ms (the closest value to 25ms, above it, and
      multiple of 4) was chosen.

- And a question from my side arised (for Sina): why have a 8ms/16ms combination
of profiles, or 16ms/28ms, if the protection that 28ms includes the protection
of 16ms, but with no penalty? The anser? It really does not make any sense,
except when having advanced G.INP. In this case the EFTR is evaluated, and with
a longer maximum delay, it is possible that due to more retransmissions allowed
the EFTR measured is really low, yielding a downgrade of the line. Allowing the
possibility of a shorter maximum delay, the lowest EFTR that can be measured is
higher than in the case of longer maximum delays, because less retransmissions
are allowed. The thing is that in the same situations, the downgrade would be
also recommended but for different reasons. BOTTOMLINE: we include a couple of
options for no particular reason, but it is always nice to have alternatives.
Nevertheless, there are limitations, posed by the hardware in the CPEs (DSLAMs)
and the buffer size that they allow, and in fact allocating a longer buffer may
(although this is just an opinion I have) have an impact on the performance of
the equipment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-19]

- First thing I have done is restarting the `reqgen` in SFR, so that it takes
the configuration as it was before LucÃ­a did a small change on Aug. 4th. After
this change, the `reqgen` was running at 18:20, while it typically was running
at 13:00, so we changed the configuration back to 13:00 (this was already there)
and restarted the module (this was the part missing) today. From now on, it
should run at 13:00, we will check it later today.

- Another interesting thing we saw last night was that in the trial lines, there
is a duplicated entry, the `LINE_ID` `491681822`. We found that because there
was some exception in the log of the DcPc, about a unique index violation, so
we used the query:

    SELECT LINE_ID, COUNT(*) FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    GROUP BY LINE_ID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    ;

To find out which was the duplicated line. So I am going to remove one of the
two entries. The only difference between both entries is the `IADMODEL` field,
which is `NB6V-FXC` and `NB6-FXC`. I am going to remove the `NB6-FXC`, because
those are the least frequent in the set of lines of the trial:

    SELECT IADMODEL, COUNT(*) FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    GROUP BY IADMODEL
    ;

    IADMODEL COUNT(*)
    -------- -------
    NB6V-FXC 15472
    NB6-SER  10291
    NB6V-SER 9139
    NB6-FXC  10832

For that only, totally arbitrary reason.

    DELETE FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    WHERE LINE_ID = '491681822'
    AND IADMODEL = 'NB6-FXC'
    ;


Guillaume sent us his initial analysis of the results of the G.INP pilot, and
we have been looking at it in the call. We also mentioned him the issue we are
experiencing with the DcPc and that we need to troubleshoot it.

In any case the plan is, right now, to prepare the report for next Wednesday, so
that we can discuss it together.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-20]

- Yesterday I set up four more POP-P collections for the G.INP DcPc, and this
morning I had to set another two extra collections for each of the already
configured (that making 6 a day).

- The idea is that for some reason when all the POP-O/P single line collections
are performed, there are LOTS of them that fail. So after the regular collection
is done, additional collections for the lines that failed before are programmed.

- The queries to select the lines that failed in the previous collection are the
following:

    SELECT DISTINCT LINE_ID AS LINE_ID
    FROM DCPC_STATUS_CODE
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    JOIN STATUS_CODES_DESCRIPTIONS ON (STATUS_CODE = CODE_NUMBER)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND CODE_TYPE = 'DcPc'
    AND STATUS_CODE > 101 AND STATUS_CODE < 200
    AND COLLECTION_DATE >= TRUNC(SYSDATE)
    AND TO_CHAR(COLLECTION_DATE, 'HH24:MI:SS') > '12:00:00'
    ; -- for POP-O

    SELECT DISTINCT LINE_ID AS LINE_ID
    FROM DCPC_STATUS_CODE
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    JOIN STATUS_CODES_DESCRIPTIONS ON (STATUS_CODE = CODE_NUMBER)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND CODE_TYPE = 'DcPc'
    AND STATUS_CODE > 201 AND STATUS_CODE < 300
    AND COLLECTION_DATE >= TRUNC(SYSDATE)
    AND TO_CHAR(COLLECTION_DATE, 'HH24:MI:SS') > '12:00:00'
    ; -- for POP-P

Here we are not taking considering the collections which code was [2|1]00 and
[2|2]01, which corresponds to "everything went fine" and "line is OOS",
respectively.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-24]

- First thing I have done is check that the lines from the pilot have been more
or less processed, so it seems that the multiple collections that we scheduled
last week work.

- In any case, Sina sent me an Iker's recommendation to randomize the order the
lines are got from the DB, in order to see if that improves somehow the
performance. The idea is to have a query like:

    select line_id from V_PORTS_LINE_CARD_DATA
    where card_type like '%VDPM'
    and status = 0
    ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.RANDOM

In the scheduling of the collection. So I am going to include this, before 1pm
to see if it does anything at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-28]

Before I forget, which I usually do, I am going to save the
PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO in a temporary table, for the lines in the last stage of
the pilot, for which I create the following table:

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_PO_RECOM AS
    SELECT * FROM PO_RECOMMENDATION_INFO
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND STAGE = 6
    AND RUN_DATE >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-08-09', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ;

- On a different note, it seems that there are still some problems with some
lines in SFR not changing the profile correctly. For the last stage, there were
142 lines that exited PO with code 660, meaning that the profile was
"externally" changed. For example:

    553237857 -> Didn't change between these profiles
        EXP_M_2048k_480k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::2048k_480k_s8_r0_r10_d16
                                   vvv
        EXP_M_2048k_480k_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::1024k_320k_s8_r0_r10_d16
    
    471042356 -> Had the profile
        EXP_M_10M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR

        is recommended to change to
        EXP_M_10016k_1024k_INP2:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::10M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16
        
        but it changes to:
        EXP_M_10M_INP1:EXP_max_MDSL_PHYR::10M_1M_s8_r0_r10_d16

    160255596 -> Had the profile
        100M_50M_inp2:VDSL2_17a_6dB_D_EqFxt::100M_50M_s8_r0_r10_d16

        is recommended to change to
        35M_5M_inp1:VDSL2_8b_6dB_D_EqFxt::35M_5M_s8_r0_r10_d16

        but it changes to:
        100M_50M_inp2:VDSL2_17a_6dB_D_EqFxt::35M_5M_s8_r0_r10_d16

These are just three examples, but it happened to some more, so I am going to
inform Guillaume about this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-08-31]

Sara has given me a script that they used to select the control group for the
G.INP pilot of SFR, so that I can redo it now, with the final pilot group. The
script had a series of queries to pick the lines, and these queries can be
generated with the following:

    SELECT 'select LIS.LINE_ID, LIS.LINE_CARD_TYPE, LIS.SERVICE_PRODUCT, ' ||
           'LSCD.IADMODEL from LINE_INFO_SNAPSHOT partition (P20150810) LIS ' ||
           'inner join SFR_CPE_DATA partition (P20150810) LSCD on ' ||
           'LSCD.LINE_ID = ''0''||LIS.LINE_ID left join ginp_ramp_up g on ' ||
           'g.line_id = lis.line_id where g.line_id is null and ' ||
           'LIS.LINE_CARD_TYPE=''' || LINE_CARD_TYPE || ''' and ' ||
           'LIS.SERVICE_PRODUCT=''' || SERVICE_PRODUCT || ''' and ' ||
           'LSCD.IADMODEL=''' || IADMODEL || ''' and rownum <= ' || COUNT(*) ||
           ' union'
    FROM GINP_RAMP_UP
    GROUP BY LINE_CARD_TYPE, SERVICE_PRODUCT, IADMODEL
    ORDER BY COUNT(*)
    ;

Additionally, I am trying to find a set of "average" lines to analyze, as
Guillaume suggested, to avoid the "always good" and "always bad" lines, to see
if there is any more improvement there. The way to select them is with the query

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_AVG_LINES AS
    SELECT LINE_ID FROM
    (SELECT
      LINE_ID,
      AVG(STABILITY) AVG_STABILITY,
      VARIANCE(STABILITY) VAR_STABILITY
    FROM ADSL_PE_EST_SL
    JOIN GINP_RAMP_UP USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND STAGE = 6
    AND ESTIMATION_DATE < TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-08-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND ESTIMATION_DATE >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-06-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    GROUP BY LINE_ID)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND VAR_STABILITY > 0.25
    AND VAR_STABILITY < 3
    ;

I first analyzed those statistics using Pandas, and I realized that more or less
those thresholds kept quite a big chunk of "good" and "bad" lines. Another
option is to look at the average, and disregard the lines which average
stability is close to 0 or close to 3 (or above), because those would be
everstable or everunstable lines. But I think that the result should be more or
less similar, and in any case it should be more representative the lines that
changed a "moderate" number of times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-09-01]

- Today I have learned that the entries in `ADC_POP_P` have a `COLLECTION_DATE`
equal to the *beginning* of the *last counter* collected, for instance, a time
11:45 means that the last counter collected is the 11:45-12:00 counter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-09-03]

- JosÃ© suggested that I may try to compare the lines in the control group that
were recently optimized by the PO, with the lines in the "average" group of the
pilot, to see if there is something easier to "sell".

- The point here is that currently, there seems to be no difference (roughly
speaking) between the improvement observed in ADSL (currently optimized by the
PO) and VDSL (currently not optimized by the PO), and it would be interesting to
have a more clear distinction between these two alternatives, in order not to do
any harm to the PO, which is currently being used for ADSL lines.

- For that, I checked which lines in the CTRL group were recently optimized
using the following query:

    SELECT TRUNC(DATE_COMPLETION), COUNT(*)
    FROM PO_RECORD_LATEST
    JOIN GINP_CTRL USING (LINE_ID)
    GROUP BY TRUNC(DATE_COMPLETION)
    ORDER BY TRUNC(DATE_COMPLETION) DESC
    ;

And then I selected the lines that were optimized between 2015-06-01 and
2015-08-10:

    CREATE TABLE TEMP_JGARCIA_CTRL_OPTIMIZED AS
    SELECT DISTINCT LINE_ID
    FROM PO_RECORD_LATEST
    JOIN GINP_CTRL USING (LINE_ID)
    WHERE 1 = 1
    -- AND DATE_COMPLETION >= TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    AND DATE_COMPLETION < TO_TIMESTAMP('2015-08-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ;

With this the results of the stability for ADSL are a bit more consistent with
the fact that ADSL was already optimized before using G.INP. So this should sell
a bit better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-09-07]

- Regarding the problematic line from Sky `DLM-15171573`, I have talked to Sina,
and he aggrees that it looks sketchy to say the least, because it makes no sense
that the DcPc status codes for POP-P say that the line is out of service, but
then the `STATE` field in `ADC_POP_P` is filled with 0.

- It could have been "normal" if not for that, because you could have a line
that is trying to synchronize continuously, but it keeps failing, and it does
not change the status of the counters to something like 1 (Failed to Sync)
because the conditions for this state are a bit peculiar: if the line is synched
for more than 5 seconds, for each 15 minutes counter, then it will not set the
line as "Failed to Sync".

- In any case, Sina suggested that I check the type of DSLAM to see if it is
something strange, but it is not, it is ISAM, with a line card NALS-A.

- Well it seems it is something about the DcPc, or it could be, so we probably
need to talk to the DcPc team, and then, probably we will require some
collection in DEBUG mode from the DSLAM... but good luck with this, because we
have no access to anything in Sky, so it will be a bit trickier than it may
seem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015-09-08]

- I have checked the configuration that is generated for Sunrise using the
MATLAB files in CVS, and it differs from the configuration stored in CVS and
that is in production. So I have asked Mohammad to try to salvage something from
Dawei's laptop, if not, I will have to work my way to the correct configuration.

- So now, back to SFR and the possibility to simplify their configuration.
